[Music] [Music] what's up guys this is Ronnie welcome back to our Channel Total technology Zone this is tutorial 45 and today's topic will be how to generate summary from customer reviews using Lang chain and open AI okay so let me quickly explain what I'm going to do today so basically U I'll be going to load customer reviews from a website and basically it's a travel or maybe flight booking or hotel booking with site so basically it's a very popular website make my trip so basically what exactly I'm going to do I'll explain you let's say I'm going to find something here let's say uh let me uh find some hotels here okay so let me uh put something let's say let's say write Mumbai okay let's say some destination let me select okay like this okay and basically this is going to list out some properties okay anything okay it doesn't matter which property or something so maybe I just put some properties okay and after that it's not yeah it is going to give you something like West in Mumbai something like so let me actually open this thing okay so now if I go here a little bit down you will see some user reviews are there right and if you go down into user reviews you see powered by generative AI using user recent reviews okay so basically what is happening here this is generating a summary of the user reviews based on the actual user reviews whatever actually posted in the website so basically this will help one user to actually understand the U understand the look and feel the Real review like user don't have to actually go via all the reviews right so basically if you see it is saying that H poison luxurious property property with a beautiful view of Po L the stop is cesious helpful and the rooms are spacious so and so right so basically what we'll do we'll try to actually load the same thing and we'll see how exactly it is going to come right so basically uh whatever I'm going to teach you here you can apply this thing on any website anywhere and you can actually summarize the user review and you can actually give your like user uh kind of a very fast uh like uh uh some sort of thing where actually user can take a very fast division right so suppose when generative AI was not there probably uh you have to actually go through top 100 reviews right and if one review is actually going to take 2 minute 100 Review is actually going to take 200 minute right but because of jna you have to actually just spend on one minute and you will be able to understand how the property or how the hotel or how the how anything is actually going to um be after purchase or something right so that is what we'll be going to do it here with the help of L and open ey so basically what exactly I'll be going to do so fetch customer reviews from make my trip load all reviews using L chain document loader and summarize using Lang chain summarized chain okay so now first thing F customer reviews from uh make my trip so basically um before I start anything here so basically it is kind of a like um I'm just going to uh like uh uh claim this thing that I'm not going to do anything with this uh video or something like to harm any content or something I'm just going to uh uh uh face the review for educational purpose my intention is actually not to do any harm so uh just because I'm going to do it from the make my trip website I don't know what implication will have in the future but this is just a kind of uh like what do you say like I'm just considering this thing as a like uh what do I say like uh uh disclaimer so I'm just going to uh put this as a disclaimer that I'm not going to do anything with the video or I'm not going to distribute the user reviews with any other platform and not going to sell anything I'm just going to use the review for generating the summary just for learning purpose because I know most of you already requested me to create something like that many of you are just student or maybe started working in the field generative AI so I think this is a very uh good example and some real use case I should do so that is what I'm just doing it okay so I'm just putting this as a disclaimer at the beginning of the video so now first thing first how to actually get the review okay so basically uh okay okay so basically if you go down here and I'm using Google Chrome so here is the review right so 1 2 3 four five reviews are there 1 2 3 4 I think five reviews are coming every page right so what you have to do you have to click somewhere and basically click on inspect and after that you have to go to Networth right and after that you have to close this thing and now you have to go down on go to page two and the moment to click on page two there is API call happen here right you have to just copy this thing and copy as SC I think maybe something like this so let me check whether I copied it correctly or not so Sublime Text think new and control V uh I think no it is not coming properly so I think think copy as scull copy a SC where is SC go uh yes I think this one yes I think this is the thing and there should be something yes right okay I don't know why this things are coming or showing like this thing okay let's move this thing and maybe I use copy bash maybe that is more realistic yes this is fine okay so you start limit end limit okay so now copy this thing it's a cur command Okay copy it and what we'll do if you have G bash install on your computer you just open it and if somebody is using Mac you can directly paste it and from window you have to use G bash just download G bash so now just paste it I don't know why this is not coming copy yes paste it and let hit enter yes it is saying some access denied error I'm getting what it is saying you don't have permission to access this thing it is saying some access denied error uh just hold down what is this okay let's do it one more time MH okay so basically it is saying call command not found so what it'll do I'll just copy this entire thing and I just go ahead and use a call converter so basically you have to just write C to python okay so these are the tricks we have to apply and go here and paste your code here let's see okay and you get something like this right so copy to clipboard and just paste it here okay like this okay I believe this is done okay response let's execute this thing first it's done so now what we'll do I'll just try to print the response then I'm getting 200 or not let's see yes response is coming as 200 right so now we'll do Json see uh from the terminal uh it was giving the error it is not giving the error right now okay so you have to do it very fast okay I'm getting the review see the from the first page response like February 24 so thank you for taking time so basically uh let's see it is this yeah start five limit five so basically what I'll do uh I'll make it it is actually on the seven uh second page okay second page review let's check it okay response is actually uh de guest getting from the something actually there so let's verify this thing whether I'm getting the same thing or not so let's close this thing and let's see whether I'm getting this thing here or not yes see yes right right so check this thing this is actually same so someone it was wonderful and something so same thing should be there so yeah you see yes it was wonderful stay this was the guest wrote and after that hotel manager said right so everything is fine so now what we'll do we'll just try to actually start from one and make it let's say, let's see whether we'll just uh do it in that way but before doing this thing what we'll do I'll just make it one to five okay right and what we'll do I'll just make it uh data equals to this okay and print so it's a dictionary so print data of keys I don't know what are the keys are there to face the exact like uh uh what do you say the review text I need this thing so basically payload so basically things will be available inside the payload okay so just copy this thing and what will be going to happen I'll just reuse the same variable okay so again it should be data of data payload right something like this and after that I'll just write print data of keys okay like this okay let's see okay so response so basically again the same thing data equals to dat of response okay now print of data right okay so basically again probably we'll be going to get another keys so let's see how many keys are what are the keys are there so basically mmt so mmt is the key so maybe so this is the last thing so maybe I can just write rows equals to this plus Capital mmt right and let's print this rows okay hopefully this is going to give me a list okay like this so if you are not familiar with Pythons then it will be difficult so you see it's a least so now what will happen what I'll do I'll just write for Row in rows print row right okay so all five came okay probably all five came actually so basically I just need this review text right so basically this is the review text and response text so basically um what you need uh response review response data business I need yeah review text I basically need this review text for everything okay so there will be total five review text let's see okay so all five can okay right H so now this is the main list so we need to actually check check the length of this thing so print length of row so basically this is going to tell you the how many reviews are there so it should be five in my case five so basically to make this thing uh now bigger I make it th let's see thousand reviews are coming or not okay so what I'll do I'll just first try to actually uh keep this thing commented and see how many we are going to get so total 666 667 uh like reviews are there right so basically now what we'll do we'll be going to actually uh only 667 uh 67 reviews are there so basically it's not much so now what we'll be going to do we'll be going to actually um try this thing for some bigger like Hotel so it's a bigger hotel but it is it has not that much of review okay so what I'll do I'll just uh go to some other hotel and do it okay so basically yeah so maybe the Leela Mumbai or which one so I'm just trying to get some yeah maybe this hotel will be big Sahara star a f star hotel okay so what I'll do now all datas are available I need more data so that because of that I want to do it so basically I'll just slowly go down here and I'll click on where is the review review is not here strange there is no review actually uh where is the review strange very strange okay okay I think okay let's search again there's a problem in the website basically nothing else I don't know just close this thing close this thing and let's start from here again maybe yeah let's click this thing I want to understand why the review is not coming for this thing yes see the review is coming so let's go down now inspect Network now click on this thing copy bash it's coming here so basically copy to click board and what we'll do we'll just try to change everything here and up to this part everything is fine now what we'll do I'll just try to load this thing hopefully this is going to give us one 5 right so 1 to 5 coming so now what I'll do I just make it 1 to th000 right th000 let's see how many are coming now uh none type object is not responsible let's see let's do it one more time yes th000 is coming so sometime it is a delay so th000 let's see 1 to 5,000 let's see maybe it should be if it is more than 2,500 it also very good number okay so I'm just requesting very fast because of that it is not coming so let's see yeah so 5,000 is not a very good number so let's try to actually do it 35 okay I'm requesting very fast because of that it is okay maybe my IP or something get blocked they understood that I'm just doing this thing okay so let's try with 20 ,000 okay yeah so that's it so maybe uh I'm not able to fetch because some error I'm getting hopefully yeah thousand is coming like I don't know what is the problem after th000 so let's try to do it after 1,000 yeah 1,500 is also coming let's try with 1900 yeah 1900 is actually a problem so maybe let's do it with 18800 so 1800 is actually not there 1800 is also there so 1850 maybe a good number yeah 1850 has a problem so maybe 1830 okay 1830 is a number roughly we'll be going to do it right so now what we'll do I will just delete I don't me this part but rather than what I'll do I'll just try to actually take the review text and I'll actually try to put it somewhere so basically what you'll do okay so we'll be going to write the review in a file okay and every review will be written as a paragraph okay so what I'll do with io. openen review. txt then a okay f1. WR right so this is just a review and after that I'll be just going to give new line character to new line character means uh like U kind of paragraph and after that I'll be just going to coost F1 do close okay done so now what will happen uh all the review will written in a file and I'll be going to open that file after this thing is done so this is just fing the data and putting it to a document so that I can load this thing using Lang okay so let's do it okay so now it is giving me error that 1830 has no data strange okay so let's wait yeah it's done now okay okay so everything is loaded here right now what we'll do we'll just try to load this thing using Lang Chen U uh summarize CH and document loader first load with Lang CH document loader and after that we'll be just going to summarize this thing so let's do the summarize and now we be going to write our main code okay so first thing first obviously from Lang chain. Community do document loader it should be import what will be import hopefully most of you will remember text loader right and now what we'll do we'll be going to load that so basically you'll be going to create a variable loader it will be text loader and what we'll do inside that you'll be just going to write review. txt right and we'll be going to write doc equals to loader do load like this right now it will will be going to actually create the so it should be from Lang chain open AI import uh chat open a right so now what we'll do Chad open AI we'll be going to do and we do temperature equals to Z and what we'll do model equals to let's see we'll be going to do GPT hyen 4 hyphen turbo hyphen because I'll be going to use a long paragraph So basically I need maximum number of tokens right so because of that I'm just using this thing right so next thing is actually um I have to actually use a uh summarize chain okay so how to do that so from L chain right dot chains right do summarize import Lo summarized chain right now what we'll be going to do we'll be going to create a chain right so load summarized chain right llm and then chain type equals to stuff okay now what we'll do we'll just execute this thing see whether we are getting any error or not okay so okay so now the main problem is again uh okay so guys if you remember like when you are going to do this thing from this computer we always going to get an error for document loading purpose right this PWD error so because of that you have to use a Mac computer for Windows computer these things are actually going to give you the error so what I will do I'll just qu uh I'll be just going to uh quickly switch uh to my Mac computer and then come back okay just give me one minute switch to my Mac device so basically the same code I have written so let me just uh run it from here so hopefully I won't get any error so same file everything is same here okay I just copied here okay now what I'll do I'll be just going to uh uh create the summary of that okay so last part so basically for that let's say I'll be just going to write something called result right and result will be actually chain dot what so basically chain do invoke and inside that what you have to do you have to actually uh pass your docs so basically this one okay okay so let's see so this is going to give me the summary okay so let's wait and in the review the same document is actually loed okay okay so it's loed so what I just going to print the result now so no error means I can print this so let's see okay all right so oh what is this I don't understand it is basically print everything I don't understand chain load Su LM CH open temperature zero model is this one do equals to load. load oh uh I don't understand what is the problem [Music] here [Music] St okay let me use chain run so let's clear this thing and try once again okay let's see ideally should not be the case I don't know why it is doing that strange I use the summarize but it is it didn't summary actually okay but run and in run is already Dee depreciated so yeah so I don't know like that invoke is not working so basically you see it is now generating the sumary so it's fine so uh whatever we are trying to achieve that is achieved so Sara Hotel star offers a luxurious stay with eats clean stylish and roomy accommodations excellent service and a variety of dining option including restaurants bars and coffee shops its grander and proximity to the airport terminals make it a convenient choice for gets guest the hotel Ambiance is Pleasant with attentive and efficient service making it a great value for money yes appreciated the warm welcome cleanness and the variety of food option available the lag views from the rooms are particularly loved and the hotel's location makes it easily accessible from the domestic airport however some guest experience issues with the room Comfort cleaning L service efficiency overall Sara star hotel is a is a is highly recommended for its amazing Hospitality Cooperative stock delightful breakfast and unbeatable Ambience making it a must visit place for a memorable stay let's check it as per the website okay so let's see the properties located near the airport has a grand ambion the rooms are styly spacious automatic curtains the Lagoon views rooms are highlight the breakfast has was spread and delicious the stops are friendly helped how some faes the room service and maintenancing the food is expensive some gu Ed average the property needs maintenance renovation overall it's a good property so basically some differences are there but overall 80% is actually match as per the website okay so that's it but again just because I'm using the make my tri data so it's again a disclaimer I'm just using it for learning purpose and for Education purpose my intention is actually not to do any commercial thing with this thing this is just for learning purpose okay hopefully uh make my trick will understand this things no what I'll do I'll just going to uh conclude the video over here so guys that's it you requested for this sort of video I just created this thing with a real website so if you're from India you might be knowing what is make my Tre and you can try the same thing with any other website right just you have to do a little bit of tweak or tricks you should know to actually face the uh like reviews from the API okay so after that you can do with any website or anything like if you have the data you can do anything right so I am using here uh summarize uh load summarize change maybe if you want to use in a different probably you can use something like llama index or something else some other orchestration tool I'm here using Lang CH so that is I'm using this thing even you can actually use it from open AI like if you send this to open Ai and query using uh send a prompt and you ask it to actually give the summary with some pros and cons it is actually going to give you that way as well you can try that as well like this is your context and you can actually use a uh chat prom template and you pass that prom template that here is a context you have to actually get the summary based on PR and pros and cons and after that you will get something right so that is in a different way of doing it right there are multiple ways of doing it but the ultimate thing is that I got so many requested request from you guys so create this sort of tutorial I'm just doing it and then I'm trying to actually keep everything more or less realistic with some real world example right so that is why it took some time actually to come uh to actually come and upload the video right CU I was not able to find out some real example so that is why I took some time like I think I took almost seven or eight days break to actually find the right like topic and the right uh like data because I can create this thing with some dummy data but that won't actually help you guys to understand but now you understand the implications of this thing how critical this things right okay so hopefully you guys are enjoying this series and you also like the

conclude the video over here guys please uh watch the video and try to actually practice the way I'm just doing the code you have to do in that way only if you don't write your code by your own you will actually forget everything right so that is a recommendation once you watch the video after watching the video once you finish the video just try to practice this thing from the scratch that will also help you okay so that's it and we'll see you in the next video till then take care goodbye have a nice day and happy [Music] learning the
