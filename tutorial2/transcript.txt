[Music] [Music] this is Ronnie welcome back to our Channel Total technology Zone this is tutorial one and today's topic will be how to create blog post on any topic using cre AI so this is the first tutorial on this playlist so if you are if you very new to our channel so this is the right time that you are actually watching this playlist from now onwards I'll be going to upload like um I will be going to upload regular videos on this playlist okay so if you haven't subscribed to our Channel Please Subscribe and also try to share our videos with your family and friends so that you should not or they should not miss any notification from our uh from our upcoming videos okay so uh I'm not going to talk much on the CI because there are multiple like uh documents ation and links are available so rather than this thing I'll be just going to start with the Practical implementation of thei so let's start with the next slide so basically what is crei so basically first follow these two links okay this link are actually going to give you very good understanding on crei right so basically from this text you can easily understand that crei is a combination of multiple agent so it's a framework which actually helps you to uh collaborate comparatively working with multiple agents to achieve something big so basically if you have a complex task which requires the uh like interaction between or which request the execution from multiple agent and the agent should interact with each other then probably this is the framework you should use okay so what are the basic components of PRI so basically agent task tools process and c and again I'll be not going to discuss this thing in very detail in theoretical part if you go ahead with this documentation you will get some idea but let me tell you something so first we'll create the agent agent will be actually going to be created with the help of tools and agents are actually going to run some task and task will be part of process and overall all these four things going to create an single C okay right so that is the high level thing right so that is what we'll be going to understand today when you're are going to create a blog post on any topic using CI okay so what are the recommendation or sorry what are the prerequisite so basically you have to install only this two module like 3i and 3i tools right okay so next thing is actually let me check this thing okay so basically uh just hold on um what is this thing here just hold on yes so basically uh forming one cre with enhanced configuration to research and write block post on any topic this is is the today's topic so basically first we'll Define agent then we'll Define task with the help of task we'll form a queue and after that we'll start the execution right and the code will be available for this tutorial here right with that note I'll be going to start the tutorial now so just stay T so in the next section I'll be going to start working from my vs code okay all right so I have already opened my uh vs code so first thing first we'll be going to uh like import this module like cre from CI agent task and cre next thing we'll be going to import OS right import OS right and next thing what is required just hold on okay so from G AI tools import so we have to import some tool so basically what tool we be going to we going to Google Search tool so it will be surer D tool okay say so these are the things will be required so let's import and uh see whether we are going to get any error or not okay so basically just hold on so let's try to do this thing now so yeah so no error so all modules are import if you're getting error you have to actually import like install crei and crei Tool using pep installer so that I already uh like shared in the PowerPoint slide now basically to work with this serer dep tool basically it's a Google search API tool we have to actually uh use something called um what do you call like uh serer API right so how do I actually do with this thing so [Music] basically I think just hold on uh where is my Google Chrome okay so yes so basically you have to go to this link okay Sur API uh then you have to sign in okay once you sign in you'll be going to get a API it's a free plan so I'll be just going to copy this thing so don't worry out don't worry guys I'll be going to change this API key after my job so basically what I'll do here so I'll be going to create something like OS do Environ like this and the key will be ser server API ke right like this okay okay so that's it so let's see whether getting any error or not so no error so we'll be going to form the Search tool here okay so first thing we'll be going to for a Search tool so Search uncore tool is going to the serer dep tool so basically serer def tool like this so if we not importing the API key properly this will not work so it's working means there is no error right so this part is done now we'll be going to start working with the agent so first I'll be going to create a research agent okay so we'll be going to name it as researcher r e a c a r c h e r research okay like this and we're going to use this agent okay so this agent class okay so agent and what are the things will be required here so probably it's required something called multiple things will be required right so basically it's requires something called role okay so basically it's in small obviously so let's define a role maybe senior research senior uh research research okay senior research scientist or something like that or maybe research engineer or maybe consultant okay something like that or maybe you can even call it like say it's also fine okay so next thing goal what is a goal right so let's fix a goal here so basically uh let's say I'm just thinking we have to write a goal okay so uncovered top [Music] maybe top three trending uh news on on a given on new in or let's set topic so basically it will uh find top three trending news this topic Okay so then probably veros equals to true so basically okay so it's a Boolean so hopefully I can simply write true right so what else is required we be going to do memory okay so memory also is going to be true right now what is actually going to happen we'll be going to do backstory right [Laughter] right okay so what is the backstory so back story is actually going to tell what is exactly this research is actually going to do so I actually created this backstory when I'm creating this tutorial I'm not going to type it but I just copy paste from here so if you see here I have written something like that so I'll be going to share this file as well with you in my GitHub link so probably you can use use the same thing right so basically I'll just copy paste and write it after that I'll read it okay so I'll be going to read it now just I copy paste it so as a research assistant dedicated to uncovering the most impactful Trends you are propelled by Relentless curiosity and commitment to Innovation Your Role involves delving deep into the latest developments across various sectors to identify and analyze the top trending news within any given field the pursu not only satisfies your thirst for knowledge but also enables you to contribute valuable insights that could potentially reset understandings and expectation on a global scale right so I'm not an English uh literature student so basically this prompt I got it from chat GPD so again so I'm not hiding any fact here okay so it is done so now next thing is actually after backstory what is required so after backstory you have to actually mention the tools here right so basically backstory is actually uh part of something like this like this and this then comma then probabbly tools okay okay so basically we have to actually this tool this is the tool I'll be going to search tool and then what else is required after that we have to write allow delegation so allow delegation will be false okay allow delation equals to false okay right okay so that's it okay so this agent is created so okay so actually here it will be delegated to another agent so it will be two actually okay so just hold on two okay so this is done so basically then I'll be going to create a this is going to search and then I'll be going to another agent called writer okay so basically what I'll do I will just copy this thing okay so what do I'll just copy this thing and I'll change the name to writer maybe blog underscore writer okay so agent so basically role will be writer um expert writer okay basically [Music] uhbe I can just write generate and write maybe WR write compelling contain contents in in things about about stopic okay so veros equals to to memory equals to to and back story again going to come from here [Laughter] right okay okay right so what I'll do I will just change this thing here right okay done so basically Search tool will be same and it is not going to be delegated to any here so I'll just use false done all these things are done so basically our agents are created so now what we now we'll be going to create the task okay so agents are created so we'll be going to create the task so first task will be what first task will be research task okay so we'll just create research underscore Tusk something like that and there probably uh I'll be going to use this task okay [Music] so okay and like this okay so first thing this cryption something like this okay equals to and then like this okay so now I will write something which I already defined here so this is see here yes so I'll be just going to write this so we going to multi-line so probably can write like this okay so what I do okay so something like this like this like this like this okay this okay so this is a description again I got it from chat gbd so identify the next big Trend in the topic focus on identify floss and cons of the overall narrative your final report should be clearly articulate the key points its Market opportunities and potential RK right so this is done then what is the expected output so after comma we'll be going to write xed underscore output like this okay so again I have already here so okay so comprehensive three paragraph long report on the latest uh basically uh what do you say uh latest trends okay so just hold on um how to actually write this thing okay the next thing is actually uh so reach us tool liqu description and probably uh this is also kind of tools required and what type of agent is required so basically you can use like tools okay so tools tools will be actually Search tool and we have to actually pass something like agent right okay so agent is actually okay so what actually be going to use as an agent so this agent is actually going to be researcher okay so I'll be going to this is researcher okay so probably this is done so this is for this uh what is actually happening here I don't [Music] know what is this it is finished here this is finished here this is finished here so we have to actually put a comma here that is why it was giving the error so all done so now I'll be going to create a right task so research task is done then uh it is going to be right T okay so same thing so after research task I'll be just going to write uh write task okay so agent will be so blog writer Search tool and I just need to change these two things again I already have this thing here so okay so basically it is not latest in F and probably we just going to right so compos a delightful article and basically right all done so one agent two agent one task two task okay so all task are actually assigned to specific agent so now next thing is actually what we'll be going to form the que so we just following this thing if you check here agent done task defined now we'll be going to create the crew right so I'll just write something a variable called crew cre is actually going to crew okay so crew is actually going to consist of Agents so basically agents okay agents how many agents are there so basically researcher comma log writers we have two agents right so what are the task we have so basically task again it's a list so basically research task and write task task are also done now next thing is actually what process we have to going to form a process so basically process is actually going to be uh okay so we have to actually so process right so going to be so process dot process dot why this is not [Music] showing k i okay so process dot uh okay sorry so process sequential screw can be kick off sequential done and everything is fine so now what we'll be going to do we'll be going to create a result so basically I'll just write r r s you to result so in the result we'll be going to actually launch the cre so basically crew do kick off okay so what exactly we'll be going to do I'll be going to pass uh something like this um just hold on uh uh uh I did miss something I'm just thinking so agent is in the right task I Define agent I Define search Tool uh okay so uh in the right task yeah so right this couple of more things is actually required so what will be our output that I defin did not Define so I can write as sync as YNC YNC s sync extion so it should be false and we have to mention our output files because where exactly it will be stored output uncore file okay so our output file will be a block post so basically I can simply write uh blog post ND markdown file okay so all done hopefully so now it is going to be kickoff so in the kickoff uh it should be inputs right inputs okay something like this and this input is actually going to be taken off with the help of keyword so basically my topic is my variable name topic so and topic is I'll be going to send so basically maybe I can send uh AI camera AI cameras AI on cameras digital okay so let's start writing this thing and at the end uh you don't need to write anything on the console it's a as I said like if you go here so verbos equals to true so you'll be able to see everything here and a block post will be written here like with the name of like this uh block post. so what I'll do I'll just clear everything and let's start the execution okay okay so that's it if everything is fine it will start okay started okay so just follow here so it will be started here so it is doing something so just ignore unauthorized and everything there something internally coming I don't know for what actually it is coming but you can ignore that mistake because everything is happening at the back end okay and internally it is using open AI okay and I have already set the environment variable because of that it's working okay okay mhm so it is saying that it is not able to uh uh search this thing right now because of some difficulty what is that I don't know so let's see okay so let's see what is actually created here I'm sorry but I'm currently I'm to complete the task due to technical difficulties with the internet search tool I will report this issue to the technical team and try to complete the request as soon as possible so basically I don't know maybe uh surar surar AP I key so some problem with the Sur Dev tool okay so let me check Search tool is here okay search tool is here Search tool is here and also Search tool is here so what is the problem okay so let me check uh one more time uh with this Sur API this API key and everything is fine okay so let me under search done how many searches are done this month let me check free plan searches in account creation searches per month is this I don't know what is the problem okay so just hold on let me try this thing one more time this thing and maybe I can try again one more time and also I check whether my internet is working or not yes my internet is even working so let's execute this thing one more time okay okay so let's execute huh again it is coming with unauthorized but uh when I actually testing the tool for the first time that time it was giving that error but it was working like I don't know why this time it worked okay let's see let's see something is happening at the back end I don't know what is that okay so now it is able to find it yes yes yes yes okay fine fine it is able to find something okay so let's see okay I think it is done let's set wait actually mhm so it is searching so sometime due to some internet it's giving some problem okay okay yes so it's giving error but just ignore that ER it is able to petch everything so it's done so let's check here okay okay so you see advancment advanc implication of AI digital cameras so everything is here right good okay so now what I'll do we'll just try to change the topic and I'll try to actually create something new okay so maybe I just delete this thing and let's actually try something different okay maybe AI on digital okay I just did a spelling mistake okay K okay so do something different uh smartphone [Music] smartphone at present or maybe I can just write latest smartphones okay so let's see how this is going to do okay so let's wait okay okay so it's working you see okay okay so whatever we are trying to achieve that's working okay so don't worry so sometime if you get some Network related error just um don't worry or don't panic it will even work so just now it happen with me okay so maybe now it is generating something some new topics so because of that it is taking some time yes latest trends are actually collected hopefully it is done good okay what I don't know what I did but it is generated with some nice looking headlines as well okay okay so this is super cool okay so with that note I'll be just going to uh conclude the video over here so maybe uh you guys can try out the same thing with some different topics and maybe you can extend this thing probably first research then actually write and after that you want to create a blog post and after that you want to actually upload that MD file to a S3 bucket directory so you have to create a third third agent so third agent is actually going to upload the file okay so that is what actually you can do so just take it as a homework and just try to achieve it if you're not able to do it just let me know probably we can Target this thing in the next tutorial okay so yeah so that's it that's it for today so before I actually conclude the video um and just say goodbye
