what's up guys this is Ron welcome back to our Channel Total technology Zone this is tutorial 116 and today's topic will be very interesting in this tutorial I have actually going to show you something very interesting and that is related to Reddit okay so in last um I think in last month I got I got some request uh from one of one of my clients that they're trying to develop one knowledge base um for their for their employees but they want to generate the knowledge base not from uh stack Overflow uh sorry they they they they wanted to generate the knowledge base directly from stack Overflow and readit okay so uh but initially they wanted to develop uh it with the Reddit like post like for example uh I hope you guys know what is Reddit so let me actually open an here basically this is reddit.com so in the reddit.com generally uh like everyone post some question they get some answer and then uh you can go and ask uh for a follow-up question and ET it's it's is just like a community not only technical things are there uh like it has multiple categories maybe thousands of 10 thousands of categories are there so you can get information about anything like from uh General Studies to uh Finance maybe some cooking some photography some travel uh if you are like uh if you are interested on like share Market Stock Exchange broking like property asset real estate all different categories are there right okay so uh so our Target is to uh actually develop a system uh uh with the help of llm so that whenever the internal employee or their employees going to ask something in their portal the portal basically fit the information uh directly from the RIT and do it but then they actually Chang the plan uh because um redit um API is there but they wanted to actually create something uh like r or something like they wanted to refresh the system once in a day but rest of the time uh the results must be coming from their internal Vector database okay so let's forget about that thing now uh my objective is actually to develop a system which will U first load the red redit post into uh into your local system and after that you can create or you can dump uh those things into a vector database and after that you can do some so basically it will be chat with redit using Lang Chen okay so similarly if you can write chat with PDF chat with Etc so here we are directly going to chat with Reddit but the most important part is actually how to use l Chen to get the post from Red Reddit okay for that first you have to go to this link reddit.com this I I believe all of you will create a account on R and after that you have to go to this link I believe I have given this thing here right r app so let me just copy this thing and paste it here right so will not forget okay and once you go there have to actually put something like this so I have created a name llm to select script here you have to write llm and the redirect URI have to put like this okay and after that you have to like select this thing okay okay so this is cre this this is the first part okay now what we'll do I'm just going to show you something very interesting but before that just give me one minute I'm just actually trying to check whether it is uh giving uh the correct thing or not just give me one moment okay okay just give me a moment yeah okay so basically this is my I think this is my client ID this is my secret this is my user agent you have to remember the things those things will be required okay so our app is created so now with the help of this app or you can we can think this as an API Gateway we can easily now uh extract the information from the radi so this is very important okay okay so now what we'll do we'll just going to uh open our V code and start writing the code but if you see here we have to install this thing but I have installed already so I'm just skipping this part now we'll be going to start working directly on the coding part okay okay so let's start writing the code okay okay so let's start writing the code first okay okay so first thing we need to import okay I I need to make it little bit bigger from l Community okay okay document loaders okay this time I'll be going to import credit post loader okay so where is uh what is RIT yeah okay right so let's uh load the r post first okay okay loader equals to creit post loer so it requires couple of parameters okay okay so it's here everything is written here okay so what I'll do I'll be just going to copy this entire thing okay let me copy this entire thing I don't like to remember these things blindly okay now we'll be going to do everything one by one okay this this such queries okay think categories this okay okay right so these are the parameters these parameters are required right so first of all it will be client ID equals to okay so let's see then client secret equals to everything will be equals to then user agent equals to so few minutes ago we created this Stu so what I'll do I just go here just stay with me I'll do everything here so this is the client okay what I'll do just go here okay past it okay done now what you have to do you have to just get the client secret from here right just copy okay this is a little bit you guys will become impatient but don't worry okay so this is user agent okay they call it as a developer but basically this will be user agent basically it's your username okay on the API so now the search queries so this things are interesting little bit so what's saries you want to use okay what mode I think mode is actually not required because um mod will sub subed it so because we just want to read it based on the this thing then categories okay so search quer is there mode is there I think categories does not matter okay going to search Okay Okay so here what we'll do hold on so here I'll be just going to write um in the search queries just thinking what I can write okay so let me some uh thing something from here okay basically this is Indian cricket okay so let's Okay so let's copy this thing from here okay okay right this is string but it will be it will be basically sub subred edit something like that it will be subred edit sub R okay right so number of post will be integer okay so what I'll do just to show you guys first I'll load one post and after that I'll be just going to load multiple port okay right so loader is ready then do doc equals to loader. load right okay hope you guys understood right then what we'll do I'll going to do things first I'll be going to print the docs to check whether I'm getting the documents or not next going to okay let's do it okay okay if you see okay so up to this point I think everything is clear I got one document and if you see there is only one document right I'll be just going to uh kind of a pause over here okay because um because my internet is actually not very uh like fast so what I'll do I'll just pause it here and I'll just going to actually um create another video because if the video length will become longer then with my slow internet connection it will be difficult for me to upload in the YouTube so I'll just going to come back in the second part just stay tuned okay all right so now uh we loaded the document so now what we'll do uh we'll be just going to load 100 documents and see okay okay 100 documents are loaded right now what will happen will be going to actually uh split the document right so first from L do text spitter import recursive character text spitter right then we be going to import from Len do lcore import yeah I believe these things are done this are required actually uh to do some complex topic right I think most of the things are done right so now we can easily uh okay one more thing is required uh so we want to create a vector DV with that so from from L chorea importa right I think let's minimize this thing okay uh let me do a clear here okay okay everything is fine now now we'll be going to our document is ready and I don't want to print this thing so what will be going to happen now we'll be going to actually create a document uh we going to create a text splitter okay so splitter maybe PS splitter t s text splitter so recursive character text splitter right so it will be it will have chunk size chunk size chunk size let's say I will make it let's say th000 okay and chunk overlap is going to five or maybe 20 right now what you have happen uh split document so this actually split documents I'm just going to use shortcut document name sorry shortcut variable names but this is not advisable recommended just to um uh make it a little bit faster I'm doing it yes this is this variable uh split document right so what we do we just going to put our dots this is this is this things I want to split right docss right and I don't want to okay okay so let's see if the spting is done correctly or not to know this thing I want to just print this SD only once okay okay all done now what will happen we'll be going to create a vector DV from this document right so let's say create VF okay so choma okay dot from documents right so I'll be just going to put SD s means splited documents right and then embedding equals to embeddings right and I want to actually save this thing in my local so that I should not run the entire code again and again so directory something like this like this this and then vs okay done okay so let's see okay uh okay okay if you see here it is saying that it has a metadata which type is reditor so as a result it is not able to actually do that okay uh okay what you have to do they have suggesting that we need to filter this out what I do I just going to copy this thing Okay contr C I'll be just going to paste it here okay and at the I'll just write from lit okay and then import okay done and here what will happen uh okay s d right okay so let's delete this thing okay now let's execute again hopefully this time it will be available here okay all done okay it's created now what will happen uh I don't want to actually run this things again and again so basically basically you can easily uh uncomment this part sorry comment out this part and this part as well okay because Vector stor is loaded here right so first part is completed now I want to actually but before that let me actually write lmal to chat okay and model four okay all done okay right right now now what will happen I want to actually take the reference from here this this thing so for that what will happen G Isa okay and I just want to take the reference from there so purs directory it should be sl. vs okay like this okay then and embeding functions equals to open embeddings like this okay all done see whether it is working or not let's check definitely it will be working it is just going to read it it will be very fast as well and it is already completed if you see here it is completed okay so execute and it will finish now instant actually okay it's loaded so no problem at all now what we'll do now we'll be going to actually ask a query and check whether it is actually going to get that information or not okay clear okay so let's do that okay uh I'm just thinking uh what to do here so let's create a variable called retriever okay and how many documents I want to retrieve you have to pass it here so it should be k equals to five okay right now what we do just going to write MD MD means matching documents Okay match docs okay it should be retriever dot uh retri do U uh um ret. invoke basically okay okay so now we'll be going to write something like uh uh India versus New Zealand okay and after that I just want to print what is happening there okay okay let's see it is directly coming from here right it came okay so yeah okay okay okay so everything actually came it's like quite nice okay but one thing I want to highlight see I don't know how many posts are there and whether it is going to um like justify the justify the context so maybe uh you always um you always um okay don't expect that you're always going to get the correct answer right basically it is creating the context match docs means it is actually going to create the context now uh now what will happen now if you want to actually uh go to the next level next label is actually means uh if you want to create a uh document chain and from the document chain if you want to actually uh get some more information right so basically uh for that uh just hold on what I'm saying here maybe uh from Lin dot uh just hold on underscore just hold on uh what basically okay L chain dot CH Dot question answering import yeah so this is right right so now I can create something like and okay by the way this things is replicated so maybe in the future this will not work but just to uh like you guys can check the documentation you will see it right so this ch um and I can just write load qn right and there are how to do it so basically LM okay what things typ stuff okays to okay stuff right then what will happen response equals to 10 do invoke do invoke sorry run actually run because invoke is not available here so input document okay so input documents equals to um uh match STS okay this match talk and the question we have to ask some question here okay okay so what question maybe maybe I can just ask uh watching Sund maybe let's see let's ask something just hold on uh okay Wasing just hold on okay how Wasington Sunder performed okay let Prince response okay okay so now something interesting will will be coming okay so let's see yeah see Washington Sund exceptionally well in the 11 11 115 rounds in this math okay okay so uh okay so this is something very interesting okay just hold on um they are saying Washington should score 115 DS I don't know because his score maybe um understand that but maybe someone posted wrongly so that's why um they put like that okay anyways so what actually I was trying to portray that is done so this is the complete code first part is actually loading the document so now what will do I'll be just going to inment this part okay and this part basically this is the first part where we loading the post from Reddit okay then you split then you uh creting the splited document and after that we converting into a vector database inside sorry not converting I'm just uh loaded that into a vector DV if you are going to use theist not required the this line is not required this will be required so depending on your like usability you can use this or this okay and after that we created a retriever and then we ask this question but this chain will not work in the future so you have to go to the length documentation and you please try to find out the equivalent CH of this thing okay so those things are documentation kind of a thing okay I believe u these things are super useful for all of you guys and um maybe you guys can create something uh amazing uh with this reference tutorial so my objective is actually to help you guys to understand how to uh load Reddit post and how to actually create llm driven application from Reddit because I search in the internet Google and even in the YouTube I didn't find a single video where um um redit integration with langen was discussed but surprisingly I found that langen already has integration with their Community redit post loader so that is the main thing right if you don't get the documents if you don't get the data there is no point okay so enough of talking so I'm just going to conclude the video over here but before I conclude i' would like to uh request you guys and this is again my personal EST I'm uploading this video after long break because you know I came for vacation and it's like kind of Festival time in
