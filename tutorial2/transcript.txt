[Music] [Music] what's up guys this is Ronnie welcome back to our Channel Total technology Zone and today's topic will be very easy and here I'll be going to show you guys how to load PDF file using Lang okay so let's uh working on this thing so basically if you see here so load PDF using p PDF so basically uh we'll be going to use Python P PDF module and that will help internally to actually load the pile so basically uh we'll be going to use uh a module called P PDF loader from which is actually available within the Lang chain document loader class and we'll be going to use that P PDF loader to load the document and where each document contains the page cont content and the metad data of the page number means first we load the file and after that uh every document or every document um within that entire set is actually going to contain one f one page from the PDF and some metadata okay so to explain this thing in detail uh let me actually try to load a PDF file so basically if you here see here I have a PDF called all India and it has let's say some page numbers are there total there are total 469 pages and some informations are there I'll be going to load this page okay so let's see okay so first thing let me okay do it like from from blank chain don't know sometime it doesn't give me this thing okay L chain document loaders [Music] import [Music] sorry input Pi PDF loader this one and then we'll be going to use loader equals to Pi PDF loader okay and no need to remember it will tell you what argument it's only one argument called file path in the file path I'll be just going to write the file name india.pdf okay so it should be india.pdf so let's first load this file and see if I'm getting in any error or not as I told you this P PDF loader internally use Python P PDF module so if your system is already having this module available it will not give you any error but that if that module is not available it is going to give you an error oh interesting thing it is saying that there is nothing called Lang chain okay so maybe just hold on okay okay so now it is complaining P install P PDF is missing so I'll be going to install that so pip 3 install by PDF okay so let's see okay I'm just continuing the installation so once the installation is done I'll going to execute this thing again okay so this time no error so it means it is loading everything perfectly well okay okay fine now what we'll do we'll just try to actually uh create a docs like combination of documents so doc equals to loader do load right and after that what will happen we'll just going to write uh for Doc in docs and we can simply write simply write print doc doc and what we'll do we'll just write print just separator one so something like this so that will be easily able to separate everything every document or every page number okay as I told you every page number is actually every document is actually going to U be the page number from the PDF okay just because it has 468 lines so it will take some time okay so it's executing so this is the last page 468 if you see here so many informations are there so just to check whether um it is giving me the right information or not see there is so many informations are available so hopefully these things are basically some index okay okay right some informations are available see 432 okay okay so yes everything is fine properly no problem is there okay so now there is another way of doing actually this thing loading this thing actually so what I'll do I'll just try to uh sorry I don't know how to actually do this thing so how to do this thing here just hold on so I just want to comment this line okay so maybe CU my these things are not working I'm trying to actually do it from the keyboard but the shortcut keys are not working okay so just hold on I'm just checking how to actually do a control let me actually oh um no still it is not working okay so let me try this thing again it's control shift maybe this one no nothing is working okay so maybe I just keep it like this thing and after that I'll just put com comment maybe I can just put a comment here like this okay like this like this okay and what we'll do here we'll just do loader dot load and split basically so this is going to load the document and split into chunks chunks is written as a document okay so we'll do that way okay and then what will happen we'll be going to actually print docs if I just do this thing what will happen let's see this is also going to take some time okay yeah this is also loading everything but this entire thing is actually a list so you can easily get the first thing like this zero so this is going to give you the first page okay yes so this is giving you the first page see like this way this is going to give all the page okay so now what is actually going to happen so maybe if I just write for I in [Music] range and it will be length of this docs okay like this and I can simply write print uh docs of I Dot Page content so this is going to give all the page content one by one okay and after that we can simply just add couple of new line here slash in SL n okay so this is going to be two new line character okay so let's see okay so this is also another way of extracting uh like information from the PDF okay okay so let's see yes so it's extracting everything okay so now what I'll do I'll just try to actually uh work with some sort of images okay so this is one way of doing it so what I'll do I'll just copy and paste this thing here okay because this this requires some sort of coding get done so what we do I'll just create a duplicate slide I will delete this part load PDF files with images with image extraction okay I would like to extract images with image extraction okay okay so how to actually extract the images so we'll do something let me check in which page I have this images okay so maybe I'll go here okay slowly go here and just try to actually open this document so basically some pages Maybe will have some Doc uh images right so let me just go and check I believe I will have image in 428 pages so yeah I have a image here so what is the page number maybe it is the page number 28 okay so what I'll do I'll just create a second file and maybe image underscore extraction py right so what I do I will just copy up to this part okay okay and I will just write [Music] print uh page 28 is actually going to start from 27 maybe let's see let's see how it is going to work yeah definitely it's taking time [Music] so okay okay so it is actually saying the page 31 so maybe uh okay page 31 so let me check which page is actually it is no pointing what is the page 31 30 yeah this is a page 31 but page 31 has nothing here so this is actually page 32 let me check okay so basically it is showing me the content of the page 31 so maybe I can actually do page 24 maybe page 24 is actually going to give me something let's see I just would like to extra some images okay so basically if you see it is not going to extract the images C I believe if image extraction is actually not part of this thing yeah it is extraction extracting the images so basically page content map one so basically it is showing map one India Today Jammu Kashmir arunachal so basically it is taking the image from page 27 so let's check page 27 okay so this is this one okay so maybe this is one so this one actually is extracting okay so let me check here so yeah I think this is yeah and and with n nagaland m these things are coming okay right so this is fine so from from the uh from this thing it is also extracting this information so basically what it is doing right now uh it is actually trying to extract the image as an information but if you want to do additional um uh you have to actually mention something additionally extract images equals to true so what will happen this will make sure that it will extract all the images as a text yeah without that this is also doing but to make this thing uh clear here or flag this thing through here it is actually going to do it for sure okay so let's see but this time I'll be able to get some errors if it is saying that this module is missing so what do you have to do have to copy this thing okay this are the learning [Music] right yes if you don't try it by yourself you won't be able to actually get to this point so that is why practice is important and doing the coding by your hand is also important so practice mixes practice and mistakes will help you to become expert and expertise will always uh give you additional confidence right okay so it's done let me actually do it in this way so now see it is definitely going to give me the same information but uh this will be more useful whenever you're actually going to deal with some sensitive data or some information which uh require additional like consideration like extract images flag equals to True okay so it is saying so now actually if you see here page 25 is blank right so because of that it's not coming so let's see page 25 that is 27 26 yes so basically it is saying part I so this is blank so that is why it is not coming okay so I'll be going to do this and this so basically after two page so maybe I can simply write 26 this time this is going to give me some information so you see here without extract images flag it will skip some pages okay if it is not able to read it will skip okay so let's see now this will extract the images and it will try to actually load everything so this is now page number 28 and it's doing the right thing okay so page 28 means it will be actually from page 27 okay so think I think this one sorry this is the page maybe page 28 okay so let's see h okay okay think this is not the one I'm looking for this is actually showing a different thing so maybe let me check which page actually is trying to show uh yes I think this is the one yes Mount Everest I think yes I think this is actually showing this part indas Ravi base so let's check okay bambra here yes okay I I think this is the one yes right so this is actually showing this image okay from page okay page 29 actually okay yes so yeah this 500 Miles 500 kilomet and so many things are there yes so basically this is the extraction of the text from that image so it is not useful at this moment but still you can actually get all the context out of your information out of your images if you actually in enable this flag equals to true so as I told you at this part we are not actually building any application we're just learning what are the different components are available within the lanen document loader class and how to actually use the different loader uh like uh uh different types of loaders like csb uh PDF Excel unstructured MD python lots of different things are there so in this tutorial we learn how to actually ex how to load PDF file how to extract information information from the PDF file and how to extract uh text based information from the images within your PDF so all these things are clear right now right so I believe you guys can actually try out this thing by your own and try to actually develop something interesting in the future and please let me know VI some sort of feedback whether you guys are actually able to do something from this context or you think that this is completely out of context like whatever you're trying to do if you if you if you if most of you are not able to find any context out of this tutorial so just let us know by some sort of comment so I'll try to actually create some real use case based because my objective was to actually uh do not concentrate on the uh Foundation part and the use case part together in this section actually I'll be going to give you guys little bit of uh little bit of idea about the different types of document loader and maybe in the future or upcoming videos I'll be going to tackle some or Target some sort of like real use cases where I'll be going to use the the functionalities from this different type of loader and try to build some real application okay so that is why I just separate these two things uh from each other so that you guys won't get confused and it will not going to be kind of a very complex kind of a tutorial for all of you okay so that's it so let me know your feedback and I'll accordingly proceed with the next videos right so before I conclude guys please try to subscribe to our Channel hit the like button if you're really enjoying our videos and also try
