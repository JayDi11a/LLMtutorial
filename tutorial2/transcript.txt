[Music] [Music] what's up guys this is Ronnie welcome back to our Channel Total technology Zone and today's topic will be very interesting so it will be how to read car license plate using Lang chain and open AI so basically uh you will have a uh you'll have a car or maybe you can have a image of a car and from that image we trying to actually read the license plate or number plate of the car so basically uh these things are very like useful for some real uh like some real world application like for example you are uh developing some sort of like surveillance system or any monitoring device or anything so there probably this logic can be used so I'm not actually going to show you how actually fetch the image and how to actually capture those image you can do it using different modes of like operation whether you can extract it from a uh live like Street gam or maybe you can actually extract some images from anywhere right so here my ultimate objective will be I'll be going to present a photo or image and from that image my uh my utility should be able to generate the uh number from by reading the license plate or number plate okay so very simple straightforward thing so what we will do here we'll read multiple images and generate card number as an output okay and this is the tutorial code so basically um I'm right now I'm uploading all the videos from a gab URL so basically if you don't uh follow my channel from the beginning probably it will be kind of very difficult for you to understand so basically um you don't understand what exactly you are doing right now because before this tutorial I have already uploaded more than uh I think 47 tutorials are there so this is tutorial number 48 so it's a humble request if you are watching this video for the first time or you are coming and to my channel for the first time then probably you should go ahead and first subscribe to my channel and then try to find out this playlist and try to watch this playlist from the beginning okay so without uh further delay let's start working the code so basically if you see here I have a folder here and inside the folder I have multiple images of like cars so like this this this like this all cars are there right so I'll be going to actually look through all these images and after that I'll be able to generate the number obviously I'll be going to do some sort of prompting and I'll be going to use open AI open Vision preview gp4 Vision preview Okay so my first objective will be actually to read the image okay so for that what I do going to actually write maybe from so pillow P right import okay it should be image Right image and going to go B 64 as well okay right so now what you do just try to actually create a function to actually read this images Okay so let's def uh image uh to B 64 string okay image to base 64 string this is my image this is my function and this is going to get an image part so just write imore okay like this right okay so first thing we have to open the image so with image do image. open open and inside that I'll be going to pass the Finish path right maybe I can just write as image like this then what we'll do we'll be going to create a buffer object okay and this is going to be I dot basically I iio dot so basically B okay then what will happen we'll be going to save the image so image should be not that small I image save right and what to save in this buffer right in this box and what will be the template or format so maybe format format will be image format Right image dot format right up to this point everything is fine now we'll be going to convert that image buffer into image string so basically I'll going to create a string variable here and going to use this B 64 right right then we'll be going to 364 en code 364 en code right and we going to get the buffer not get value right then this is done then we'll be going to uh return this IM string with a decoded format with the NF H okay return image H decode and we be going to use I right this is done now basically what will be going to happen then we'll be going to actually uh import glob and right then we'll be going to import L Chen okay so [Music] from L Chen open a import chat open a and then going to typ from lank chain do [Music] schema do messages human message okay right so first thing we'll be going to create an LM so LM equals to CH okay and model equals to GPT p for ith Vision preview right okay and Max tokens maybe I can just simp WR gp4 Vision I can previe right everything is done here now next thing what is going to happen here we'll be going to actually uh create first our working directory right where our files are actually placed so basically CWD is actually my files are actually in this in this directory so it should be uh it should be like this o do get this thing right and now what will happen we'll be going to write files equals to glob do block block right then CWD right then plus something like this okay it should be this and then star. PNG so basically all PNG files are going to come and basically what you do check try to actually check whether I'm getting this files or not in the list format okay so let's execute this thing so all files should be coming see all files are coming so now we going to direct through this thing so for file files right now what will be going to happen I'll be going to create a variable called image St strore Right image s Str is actually going to be I'll be going to use this function and in this function I'll be going to pass image path as this file so basically this and I'll be going to plus five right then then then basically response equals to llm do invoke okay now what is actually going to happen like this okay and here I'll be going to create a list again and inside the list my first thing will be human messages okay human message right so in human message I'll be going to create something like this okay so basically again it will be content like this and this will be part of a list right okay so basically it will be kind of type okay right what will be the type type will be text key value there right right and TT is what so basically again another text and this text will be what uh basically what is in the car number PL right so basically if I write this thing it will generate but the problem is actually it will think that I'm just going to do some personal information so basically I need to uh make it realize that all this numbers are fixed here so random numbers so no personal information will be distributed okay so basically what I write all numbers all numbers are right so no no personal no personal information will be disclosed okay done so first thing done next thing is actually next thing what after this thing we have to use a comma right and what is actually going to happen we'll be going to write something like this and we'll be going to write type okay type and here I'll be going to write my image URL so basically uh basically what is going to be this image URL so basically it is actually going to be image uncore URL right and what is actually the image URL okay so this image URL is actually going to be uh let me write image URL so this image URL is actually now going to be a dictionary like this this okay so basically like this like this it will be like this okay and like this just put a comma here okay and after this just put a comma okay now what is happen inside that I'll be going to this right so basically URL what will be the url url is actually going to come from the function I mean from this okay so let me write this thing first so first F if then this then data colog image right and then can simply write BNG okay like this okay then you can simply write best 64 okay like this okay and there we'll be going to write this image string okay so image string IMG St so everything is done here right so basically I think everything is done nothing need to worry and once this is done if we go here in response and what I'll do I'll just write print I'll write the file name so basically file do split split is actually going to be based on this thing and add the end basically I will have the file number uh sorry file name and then probably I can simply write print okay so if I do this thing what will happen so it will uh write the fin name and the card number hopefully everything is done so let me execute the code now okay so execution started let's see what is going to happen now nothing started yet in the console so it started so first number plate is actually this one okay second number plate is actually 682 okay we'll compare everything after this things are done okay let me make it a little bit upwards Okay Okay the third number plate is SJ 11163 right let's see what happens next okay so next one is actually CP 6018 okay okay next it MC 320 okay fine all right okay so next one is actually RP 325 5 Second okay okay 7479 maybe one more will be there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 PM 184 last one maybe total I have nine yes L y1 151 1 so basically start with this thing now so basically start with here so uh the first screenshot is actually 104 to 50 okay so 104 to 50 104 to 50 104 to 50 g number is actually USC forever yes USC for E okay fine close it so next one is actually 2504 right and F6 82 so 251 for 251 for this one C F2 682 correct right next one is actually 24902 24902 yes this one the number is actually FJ 1163 FJ 1163 clearly wrote and 249 57 249 57 249 57 is actually CP 6018 CP 6018 right so next one is 25052 250 52 250 52 is actually MC 320 25052 MC 2 320 24933 24933 is actually RP 3257 see 24933 rp25 3257 then 24844 24844 here is actually FH 7479 yes right then 248 52 248 52 PM 184 242 and then last one is actually 24944 L y1 1511 L y1 1511 all done right so that's it this is a very small tutorial but uh I believe uh you guys will like this tutorial and this is just a beginning of this sort of like use case as I promis like in the future videos I'll be going to uh I'll be going to upload um many other like real life stuff because this all the stuffs are actually going to help you to develop some sort of like use case driven application where actually you'll be going to solve some like proper uh like proper business case or something like that if you want to actually uh develop your own uh like car uh like car tracking system like I I'm just using the wrong what car tracking system but I'm just giving an example suppose you have installed a CCTV camera in front of your house or maybe anywhere and you want to actually um um track or you want to just uh create uh create some analysis like which car has been uh like going uh like in front of your house and returning in front of your house maybe if a car is actually passing from an upside Street at 8:00 a.m. maybe they're going to office maybe at the evening they're returning back so in that way actually you can actually drives some algorithm okay so this carard is actually moving at this time and they can returning this time but again all these things are actually personal like surveillance kind of a thing you should not do this thing but I'm just telling you when you're are going to do something for some company maybe you're working for a security department or surveillance department or anywhere I don't know but this sort of system can be developed with the help of a little bit of coding or little bit of knowledge of lch and this sort of things just now I showed you guys like again another thing in that you are already working for some some sort of vigilance or any sillence department and they actually have 10,000 like images and from that images you want to actually identify which car is actually or specific carard like whether this number is actually found or not or something like that right so those things can be done using this thing suppose you have a car number and you want to actually make sure that the moment you find this carard you want to actually uh send an email alert or something like that right so those things can be done using this sort of logic right so I'm just giving you some sort of intuition that how to achieve the particular case but it's up to you like after you watch this video you have to actually think beyond the thing beyond the boundary and after that you have to apply your own p and after that you can actually develop some other use case and maybe you can try to solve those things right so thinking visualizing analyzing applying your thought has to be done from your own so this small video here is only my intention to give you guys a some kind of intuition that how these things are going to be used and what exactly can be done but the actual use case could be like could be very different right when you are going to start working for a company or maybe when you are going to develop some application that time you have to think Beyond this video right so that is my humble request like once you watch this video try to actually write down The Code by your own because until and unless you are not writing your code by your own you will not gain any confidence and if you don't practice you will forget all the concept after something right you have to take it as a study like if you think that you were just watching the video and you'll like gaining the knowledge it will never happen Okay so with that note I'll be going to conclude the video over here but before I conclude I'd like to request you something that is from my personal point of view guys please try to subscribe to our Channel hit the like button and try
