[Music] [Music] what's up guys this is Ronnie welcome back to our Channel Total technology Zone and today's topic will be how to load Json documents using Lang chain document uh sorry using Lang chain Json loader okay so uh if you guys remember in in the last three or four tutorial we have started working on the lch document loader So within Lang chain document loader we have multiple loaders so we have actually discussed on text loader HTML loader then probably python loader and uh CSP loader right directory loader so in this tutorial I'll be going to talk about Json loader so basically with the name it's very simple that we are actually going to work on Json file okay so let me actually go ahead to the next slide so basically what is Json loader so basically it will uh help us to load Json documents so uh JavaScript object notion is an open standard file format for data interchange format that uses human readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attribute and value pairs or array or serializable values means it's a it's a combination of key value pair so if you are already familiar of little bit of data structure or data types from any programming language then probably you know what is Json right so Json lines is a file format where each line is a valid Json value so basically we'll be going to work on a Json line so it's a file format where each line is a valid Json means this will be a Json file and every line will be a Json okay and the Json loader uses a specific JQ schema to pass the Json file it uses the JQ python package so basically if you are not having uh python uh package JQ install on your system it will not work ultimately this Json loader will use this JQ module from python to actually pass and get the value or extract the value out of it okay so this is the ultimate objective so we'll be going to use a JL loader and internally it will use um JQ from the python package so if you do not have jko in your system then probably it will not work okay so without wasting much time let me open my this thing vs code so I have a file this is sample Json and I have actually uh like three lines okay uh let me actually write [Music] from L chain dot lenin. doent loader import Json loader okay now what we'll do we'll write loader equals to Json loader and like this and basically uh it is kinding of having this many arguments so file will be file path right or path so maybe I can write file path and there I'll be going to just write down the file name it will be sample do Json okay and first I'll do the mistake I'll show you the mistake and after that I'll fix the mistake so let's execute this thing so it is saying that one record positional argument JQ schema is missing so JQ schema means you have to tell it what exactly you want to get so basically I want everything right so maybe I can just simply write something like this okay okay let's see it is working or not it's working so now what we'll do we'll do docs equals to loader. load okay let's see whether this is working or not yeah um it is what it is saying uh it is saying uh there is a problem here so basically um we need to actually uh add something so it is saying what uh extra data just hold on uh R text line docs python in decode J jod extra data line okay so it is saying that there is an extra data for line two okay let me actually um so basically I'm actually uh looking Json lines so basically I think I have to add this Json lines should be true okay let's see yes so it is saying that uh uh we need to actually add something else as well so basically text [Music] content just hold on maybe this will be false let's see yes now it's working so basically I need to mention I'm reading actually Json line and my text content is not false like that way I have now what we do I just write print docs yes so if you see uh I got something here uh here Father John mother and children this right so so let me check whether it is giving me exact thing or not so Father Mark it start with Father Mark like this see okay so now what will happen same thing is here so so I just need the father from everywhere so how to actually this will happen so maybe uh just see whether I'm actually able to do it or not so basically content key so maybe I can just write content let me check so it will be a string so maybe I don't know like whether it will work or not let's see yes so see it is only giving me the Father John came right first it will came Mark John only fathers are coming okay so basically uh if I just do for Doc in docs print doc okay so hopefully it will only going to give me the fathers yes so basically I need to actually write dot e a g eore c n t n contain uh okay so basically it is saying that list object does not have this attribute so just hold on so let me check why this is not giving me this thing okay so it's a list [Music] actually so the single list so maybe I can just write something like this to understand whether everything is giving me properly so just hold on just separator I'm using in separator to understand okay so this is the entire value so this is a value of list so within the list basically I can simply write this okay uh let's see yes so now yes now this will work yeah so see I'm only getting this thing because always it is coming from the first element zero so always it is printing this thing so basically what will happen so okay so there is something I don't know why Always it is printing this thing so so print all only it is printing one father I don't know why so let me check okay here it is Mark then it is John okay so basically this is the entire list within the list we have multiple things so basically maybe uh uh this entire list try to understand okay so let me check how many documents are there okay so let me check the length of the document first okay it says three means total four items are there okay so maybe I can simply write for dock in Docs print doc right yes so now if you see here Mark is coming John is coming Bob is coming right okay so now what will happen page content yes now it is giving me everything right so if you don't want to actually do this thing here let's say I don't want this thing okay like this so it is going to give me the Json thing back again right okay so this is very straightforward I don't think it will require much of an explanation so if your requirement is actually to read a Json file you can easily do that using um Jason loader right and another thing like um you can actually load this thing using directory loader but again in the loader class you have to actually mention it's a Json loader or else what will happen this will take some time to parsing and parsing is very much important whenever you are actually working on loading uh some specific data and if your requirement is actually to build an efficient uh application right because ultimately your scalability and your performance and your efficiency I mean your efficiency means the application efficiency will be tested before your client or whoever is actually going to give you the task before they put something in the deployment environment or in the production they will try to actually test the system and that is what it is happening here okay okay so that's it guys I think I should conclude the video over here and um we'll start again from another uh topic from the next video but before I actually conclude this tutor I would like to request you guys on few points um first I start with um the practice of the recommendation how to actually practice this thing because this is the 26 tutorial and if someone is actually very new to our Channel or watching our videos for the first time so guys this is an uh this is a recommendation that please uh go to our channel search for this Lang chain complete tutorial playlist and try to watch the entire series from the beginning because this a 26 tutorial and before that we have have already uh posted 25 tutorial so if you are planning to actually do something in the area of uh artificial intelligence Lang chain or language model then probably this tutorial is going to help you to develop your Basics foundation and intermediates as well because if you see here we are actually working on the intermediate part and before that we already work on the basic and fundamental Parts as well so those uh tutorials are definitely going to help you to build your foundation next thing uh guys please subscribe to our Channel if you watching for the first time then also try to subscribe with our Channel and if if someone is already watching our series but uh did not subscribe yet please please please it's a request please try to subscribe to our
