what's up guys this is Rony welcome back to our Channel Total technology Zone this is tutorial 6 and today's topic will be how to draw rectangles using open cv5 okay so in the last tutorial we have seen how to draw Circle and before that I believe we have seen how to create or how to draw lines and in this tutorial we'll understand how to draw rectangles right so basically as discussed uh in open CB or with open CB we can create multiple shap multiple multiple uh actually multiple geometrical shapes using open CV drawing function so we are discussing this thing once this things are done we'll be going to discuss something uh like more uh Advanced okay so slowly slowly will uh increase the complexity of the tutorial okay so just stay tuned and try to watch the entire video and once you watch the entire video try to do some practice or else you will forget and uh the good thing about this playlist I I I generally share all the source code with you uh so once you complete um once you complete the video you can actually refer to the uh GitHub source code to practice Okay so enough of talking let's start working on the handson on the coding part okay so let me minimize this thing okay and okay so first thing put nump as NP and then import CV2 okay first thing we'll create a numpy ARR for our image structure so it will np. Z okay so what do I just going to write it will be 500 5003 right and it will be MP do U okay right now let's draw CB2 dot uh rectangle okay rectangle has IMG .1.2 color thickness okay okay so I still have the fever so the point one is actually uh top left B right point one is top left so top left is actually uh it will be I believe top left is here actually so maybe I want to create a rectangle let's see it is 500 into 500 so I can write top left top left may be here okay it will be let's say let's say 100 100 100 Z okay top left and it will be bottom right so bottom right is actually maybe bottom right top left bottom right bottom right is actually here bottom maybe I can say bottom maybe be here and right so maybe I can say uh bottom right okay so this this so maybe it will be let's say 400 by 400 let's see 400 400 me actually this maybe bottom is actually here here right and is top left is actually here right I believe this is okay then color is let's say color maybe I'll just going to give some red BG reddish color I just want to put some reddish color so maybe 45 BG 78 r r is actually going to be 231 okay and let's set equals to let's say 5 okay now what we'll do2 do IM show okay so I just write rect angle okay and there I just write IMG okay and then what will happen while true okay then CV2 do W key 1 and 0 x FF FF equals equals to D Q okay if Q then to destroy okay all done let's and yeah if you see this is a rectangle okay right hope you guys understood as I'm saying this is going to be uh going to be a red color image okay okay okay so I want to actually make it from here a little bit downwards right so maybe it will be 5 100 and then I want to make it uh let's say 100 so this is actually 100 Zer so I want to make it uh let's say 2050 okay I do press CU and try to do it yeah yeah okay so now what we'll do I want to draw another like thing inside that okay so what I'll do I'll just make it 2 okay = to 2 okay let's copy this thing here so next thing will be 70 and this is going to be uh 350 and this is also going to be 350 okay and here the color will be little bit 245 and this one okay let's execute uh so these two things are actually imposed with each other because there this line is same so I want to make it a little bit inside okay so maybe from here so it will be uh 120 okay let's do it from 120 yeah that's it but that 120 is actually not equally distributed right so maybe uh this ENT thing is actually 100 and basically I'm starting it from 100 and it is actually here it is uh kind of 400 so and is 500 so maybe let's make it 170 maybe little bit realistic yeah it is more on that side okay you can do it uh by calculating everything right so similarly um let's make it 150 and 100 okay okay right now I want to actually draw another Square inside okay some pattern I'm just creting some pattern guys nothing else okay 15 then probably it will be 200 and maybe it will be maybe 300 and maybe it will be uh 250 250 and this is also maybe 250 let's see how it is going to react here yeah this is a small thing here okay I have to understand so it start from 200 and 200 250 here and then I say 250 so 250 here and then 250 so okay so 200 250 here then 250 250 so I think I have to go little bit down here I actually go a lot of down from here so it start from 150 I think it should be 180 is actually more than enough here 180 is more than enough and if I do 180 and down let me do it yeah so 180 actually I want to make it a little bit bigger here because I'm starting it from here 180 so it should be 350 it will be 350 and at the top it is 250 so let me try what happened yeah so actually this is 350 here and this is it's actually combined with this one 350 250 250 is actually somewhere here so I don't want 2 350 I just want here 30 is fine I believe so yeah it is fine but I just want to keep it a little bit downwards so to make it little bit downwards I want to make it let's say 200 okay let's do it 200 yeah 200 is here here but here it has to be uh little bit down is uh much downwards here so what I want to do I want to just make it here top left and 500 so I want to make it let's make it 100 30 okay hopefully this will work now yeah right so now this is 330 250 330 here 250 here so this is actually 130 here right so I can 130 here and from 130 it will go to 330 here and 330 here and 250 350 here and 250 here right so here I can make it 300 let's make it 300 okay so bottom left yeah right now uh let's uh increase uh this one okay so let's make it 390 okay okay 390 is actually not useful then make it let's make it 360 okay yeah 360 now let's put some color okay so to make it color make it color it will be always minus one right I'm just trying to create some uh coordinate system and the colors and if you want to make it color F you have to use this and after that if you see okay fine so this is a nice looking uh rectangle right so now here if you see this two rectangles are same so what I'll do I just want to make a different color here okay so maybe I want to make it 187 15 okay and let's execute okay so there are total three colors are there so that is how you can create some geometrical shapes geometrical shapes using open CB uh drawing function so in this tutorial we'll learn how to create rectangle how to create some pattern within that rectangle how to create multiple rectangle how to create rectangle within rectangle so many different things using this tutorial okay so I believe that is the end of this tutorial but before I conclude uh I just want to request couple of things so first thing uh once you watch this video after watching the video try to do the coding by your own because see until and unless you are not doing the coding by your own you will not remember anything because Hands-On coding is important okay so please practice and um that will help you to uh create some other use cases out of it see whenever we are going to do some interview or in the company if you're going to work you won't get this sort of smaller or simple use case right these things are just for developing the intuition right so after watching this video you have to think through it and try to visualize and create some uh extensive uh like use cases and try to solve them if you're not able to solve them please let me know we'll try to include this thing in our upcoming tutorial and if if those tutorials are like hope those use cases are very simple I'll try to give you the solution and answer then and there okay then second thing if you're watching this channel for the first time thank you very much for watching this video so please watch the video till end and after that please try to subscribe to my channel hit the like button share my videos with your family
