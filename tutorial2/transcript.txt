what's up guys this is Ronnie welcome back to our Channel Total technology Zone and in this tutorial I'll be going to do another fun uh activity which is uh cricket match analysis with voice using AI so hope you all are familiar with cricket game if someone is not familiar with cricket games then probably you can just search in the Google but those are actually uh I believe are from the subcontinent or maybe some Cricket playing Nation for them it is kind of a very much popular exercise or tutorial so I believe um like those are again familiar with cricket game you know that for for every cricket match once the game is over then probably uh like the experts are generally um uh generally do some like um they generally do some sort of analysis like postmatch analysis with like two people of three people and there they discuss like something like how the match went who actually did well who did not uh like uh played well what went wrong for the losing team what went wrong good for the like winning team and Etc right who was the key player who was the best player ETA right so this sort of things uh generally nowadays happens like with a normal human like commentator or Cricket experts right or match analyst but now with the help of AI we will try to actually do um uh try to mimic this Cricket uh cricketing expert analysis or post match analysis or match report after after any match with the help of AI okay so it will be very fun activity so these are the things you'll be required python 3.1 you will be required thing and we'll be going to main thing is actually podcasty okay and the tutorial link is available here okay let me open this thing which I already developed so basically post match analysis here you'll be going to enter any URL right now uh it is actually based on some URL like maths are actually already completed but I want to actually try to uh mimic it from a uh like from a from a video so that actually uh that part is actually going on so what I'll do I'll be just going to record a video and from there I'll be just going to um real time try to do it okay but here uh let's say A match is actually happened between Bangladesh and West indes uh yesterday and I want to actually do that match thing okay so let's try to actually do it okay so let's hit hit the URL here and let's see how it is actually going to generate okay so let's wait so it's working you can see here e still going on okay so this is going to take some time and after that it is generally um it will basically going to create a analysis report for 2 minute or two 2 and a half minute okay so let's try to do that still going on yep it's generated if you see it is 2.14 2 minute 14 second let's welcome to postmatch analex cricketing season in going on and what a match we have for you today folks West Indies sweeping Bangladesh 30 in the Odis talk about a Domin performance absolutely thrilling series isn't it I mean chasing down 322 that's no walk in the park jango's debut Century what a story okay so I just stop it here and now I'll be just going to uh come back with the actual part how I develop all these things okay just stay tuned with this thing I'll be just going to come back in few seconds okay right so let's start the coding part of the tutorial okay let's maximize this thing this thing and let's try to so first thing first from fortify do client import generate podcast okay generate podcast okay and it just going to uh like create an stream late UI so input stream late as s okay now let's see okay so now start working on this thing so basically St do title okay and there I'll just going to write uh post match Anis by AI Cricket okay done okay now what will be the url url is actually going to be St do text input and there I'll be just going to write enter your url right now what is going to happen now I'll be just going to um uh create um the the conversation config okay how the conversation is actually going to uh be right so basically is going to create something called conf config okay config and this is basically a part of dictionary okay so what will be there in the dictionary so first thing is actually conversation style okay converation underscore style so basically it could be a uh it could be a um like list of strings so B basically I want to write detailed uh detailed cricket match uh analysis okay and then uh discussion discussion question answer then what else summary okay now next thing is actually uh roles what will be the role of the person so basically roles may be person one okay so what this person will be so maybe I can just write criting expert expert with good analytical knowledge profal professionally fluent to English Okay Char young male wife okay so just want to actually keep everything detailed okay now role of the person to I want to make it a female so roles uncore person two okay now what will happen uh maybe let's uh young female uh cricket cricket and list list okay right next thing is actually podcast name podcast name maybe Daily Post match sumary okay now let's do okay now let's say podcast tack line okay okay so now let's say criting season is going on okay done so these are the configs actually very interesting right now the question is that how I know this thing so you have to actually search this thing in the Google and and and and you have to find that documentation but still if you see here I just click here everything is actually mentioned here see everything is mentioned here see I actually like this configuration everything okay so now let's see let's create a uh podcast sorry not podcast you can call it as a podcast up to you so let's say it is actually going to generate a audio file okay so for that maybe I can just write uh audio file equals to generate podcast okay so now in the generate podcast what you want to pass I want to pass the URLs urls equals to URL okay this URL is actually coming from here okay then what is required then probably TTS model means the model what which I want to actually use to generate the voice so open a I okay right open one and then conversion config conversation config is actually going to beete it's done but I want to actually do this thing when the user enters something so basically Ally if URL is not is not none okay like this then what will happen then I will create a button uh if uh button is actually uh St do uh button is equals to submit okay then I just write if BTN means when button is pressed okay and then what will happen it is going to generate and after that I'll just going to play that so st. audio okay and then I just write audio file audio file then maybe audio data HD samp R what else is actually required F format s sample rate okay yeah this is fine okay is there anything like we can play it like um by autop play possible or not I don't know let's let it like this okay fine everything is fine right so let's actually open the terminal so I open the terminal let's execute the app stream L Run men. py Okay so it started okay so this is my app let's delete this one okay let's copy this URL from here and let's paste it here okay uh I don't know why this button is actually not showing what is the problem button equals to St do button submit is here if URL is oh URL is not none oh my God okay so let's refresh yeah it came so let's paste this thing okay fine so let's execute submit okay so it started executing because it's here so let's wait for some time and see okay okay so let's wait uh maybe this is going to take a minute of time okay post match analysis by AI Cricket so this is really really awesome guys you can actually uh do a live cricket commentary like if you are going to develop some wook kind kind of a thing so this is basically going to uh do that okay so let's wait web socket sorry not W guys sorry sorry if you create something called Web secet which is actually going to receive the image continuously or maybe going to uh receive the text continuously you can actually generate aing analysis okay so let's see okay so it's generated it's little bit bigger from the example example when I was giving the demo that time it was 2.14 now it is 2.52 so let's do welcome to daily postmatch summary cricket season is going on and what a match we have for you today folks oh my West Indies pulling off a stunning Victory against Bangladesh in the third ODI completing a clean sweep of the series amazing stuff isn't it absolutely thrilling a 322 run chase you don't see that every day especially against a Bangladesh side that put up a very respectable 321 450s in their Innings they really brought the fight they certainly did but the star of the show hands down has to be debutant Amir jangu a century on debut 104 not out guiding his team to Victory talk about a dream start to an international career it's been what almost five decades since a West Indian achieved that 46 years to be exact and he didn't just score runs he paced The Chase brilliantly that partnership with KY cardi 132 runs for the fifth Wicket was crucial and then another unbeaten 91 run stand with GES Modi to seal the deal real nailbiter until the very end oh um absolutely Modi played his part too 44 of 31 balls three sixes three fours real Firepower down the order but I think cardi deserves a lot of credit too 95 runs held the Innings together when they were in a spot of bother you're right k cardi played a brilliant supporting role to jango's heroics but let's not forget Bangladesh's Innings mahmudullah and jaker Ali's unbeaten 150 run partnership for the sixth Wicket a Bangladesh record they really pushed the West Indies 12 sixes in the Innings almost took the game away yeah interesting you know it's these little moments that can shift the momentum of a match remember that dropped catch jangu miscued one and the substitute Fielder parves Hussein just couldn't hold that could have been a turning definitely a costly Miss Rashad Hussein got cardi out the very next Ball but the damage was done jenu capitalized on that second chance I mean who knows what could have happened otherwise exactly I see and Brandon King another quick start but a run out early on those things happen in the Heat of the Moment I suppose but yeah great series for him overall a bittersweet ending for him perhaps but this West Indies team they've really shown some grit chasing down 300 plus scores isn't easy and they've done it four times now in Odis this win this series a real statement of intent couldn't agree more a stunning performance from the West Indies capped off by a truly memorable debut from Amir jangu this series win will give them a lot of confidence going forward great thanks for joining us for the postmatch analysis folks until next time goodbye byebye great guys so basically you see it knows like how to start how to build the tempo then how to actually jail with the uh audience with some interactive like um insights uh try to make some uh like um interactive between themselves and also it knows how to actually appreciate the player how to uh like highlight the key moments and also uh before actually ending the like um this cricketing uh analysis session they know how to actually uh like conclude with a conclusion message so I'm actually completely Amazed by this uh like new python like Library podcast ify so I hope you guys can uh try this out I'll be just going to share the code with all of you so please try it out and let me know and also let me know with this thing what are the things you can try and build for your like personal project maybe just for fun or just to create something for your client or maybe in future whenever you're going to start working on the generative AI like there you can use it okay with that note I'll be just going to conclude the video over here but before I conclude I'd like to say a couple of things guys I saw you guys are watching
