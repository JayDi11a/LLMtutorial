what's up guys this is Ronnie welcome back to our Channel Total technology Zone and today's topic will be very exciting so in this tutorial I'm not going to actually show you anything new but rather than I'll be going to actually do a end to end project on langin uh document loader using open llm and the topic will be an YouTube video so basically in this tutorial I'll be going to develop one streamly app which will be intelligent enough to read through an YouTube URL and it will be generate it will be able to generate the uh video summary of the same video in terms of in the in bullet forms okay so basically in the input we'll be going to provide an YouTube URL and in the output you'll be going to get a response in the form of uh like bullet points and the bullet points are actually the summary of the video or the headlines of the video so basically these things are very useful suppose you are planning to actually watch an watch a podcast or maybe a webinar something like that but due to some reason you miss that podcast or webinar but still you want to actually get the gist out of this thing so how to do that there is one way actually reading through the transcript but sometimes transcripts are actually very lengthy maybe 70,000 uh characters are there or maybe 5,000 words are there and sometimes you don't have that much of uh like um mindset to read through everything but if you get something in a nice bullet pointed way then probably or bullet pointers or maybe some pointers maybe that will be super easy to actually read understand analyze and you can easily take a decision right so basically I got uh so many request and in couple of in last couple of weeks that I should create a app and which will help us to actually develop a real application and most of you actually requested me for your like finally your college project or maybe somebody's already working on some fre and they have actually the similar requirement so here you go so I'll be going to develop a an stream uh I'll be going to develop an app and basically it will be a stream lead app okay and in that app there will be one input text box and there will be a submit button in the input text box you have to actually enter a YouTube URL and based on that it will uh load the URL uh the video using Lang chain document loader and after that it will use the open llm to uh convert that uh uh convert the document into bullet points okay so let's see okay so first thing I'll be going to actually just hold on okay so let me start writing the coding from here okay so first thing we'll be going to actually start writing our code okay so first thing we'll be actually going to import the Lang chain document loader okay so from Lang chain do document loaders import yes YouTube okay right so basically we'll be going to actually load YouTube okay then from line chain do text splitter why text splitter is actually used if the doc if the video is actually lenier video maybe the video length is actually more than 10 minutes or 20 minutes so you need to actually split the like the load loaded document into a like um into multiple document using a chunk size okay so import so I'll be going to use recursive character text printer so basically this is a 20 eight video from our channel right so now you understand why I actually did that video okay so then import open Ai and then import stream lit as S2 okay so first I'll be just going to uh create sorry the streamate context okay so maybe St do set page config right so inside that I'll be just going to put a page title okay so page title will be uh YouTube video summarizer app I don't know whether it's a very nice name but still something okay is done then what we'll do we'll just going to actually put a header st. header so it is going to be okay so what is going to be there in the header maybe uh I can just simply write uh YouTube your YouTube video URL okay and I'll just going to create a input text box so basically create a URL a variable and it should be St do U text input okay right and there we just going to write enter the video URL from YouTube okay like that okay and we be going to write if St do button okay and button should be submit of type of submit okay like this and type will be primary then I'll be going to check if URL is not n if URL is not it should be none right means if URL is actually not empty n then the whole processing will start and everything will be happen inside this okay so first thing uh I want to actually uh do a loader so I'm just going to print the URL so that I'll understand that everything is happening in the console okay then what you'll do I'll just going to create a variable called loader and this is going to be YouTube this YouTube dot YouTube loader and there I'll be just going to U from YouTube URL right and here I'll be just going to put the URL okay done and then what will happen so docs equals to loader. load right okay so now what I'll do I'll just going to uh run this thing so that I'll be able to understand what is happening so what I'll do I'll just write a docs okay it is not required but just check whether it is able to do everything or not so basically what will happen uh I'll just going to execute this thing stream late run and then men okay okay so it's working okay so here I'll be just going to put an video URL so what URL I give so maybe let me open a YouTube url so maybe uh okay let's see some popular Indian channel so maybe I don't know maybe something from here so maybe what I'll do um maybe I'll just copy this thing copy this okay and let's see whether it is actually able to do anything or not okay okay so I believe uh I think I will get a uh copyright strike maybe okay so I don't don't know how to actually do that so yeah but there is no sound coming so maybe I won't get a copyright strike but again this is just for an education purpose YouTube Don't ban me actually I'm just doing it for educational purpose okay so submit if I do a submit so let's see I got this thing here immediately okay so this is amazing right now our job is to actually get this thing uh like kind of a in this format so what I'll do I'll just close this part okay and I'll do it okay okay so so again uh YouTube please don't Manan me or don't put a copyright strike because I'm just doing it for educational purpose my intention is not to copy or do anything okay this is a very informative video so I'm just doing it uh for sake of knowledge okay okay so so what will happen now now I got this thing here right now I need to convert this entire document into a um for example if you just do a length of this docs how many characters are there let's see how many characters are there this will tell you okay sorry so okay so basically let me tast it here let me type it here um okay so length of the docs is actually this thing that is for sure okay so maybe I can just do docs zero and then page content right so maybe now this is going to tell me something okay so maybe let's do it okay so if you see there are total 68,000 characters are there okay so what I'll do we'll be just going to actually split everything okay so how to do that so what I'll do uh we'll be just going to actually do right so TS equals to recursive uh recursive text splitter so recursive character text splitter right then probably chunk underscore size and maybe I can convert the CH size into 7,000 okay so that there will be total 10 documents and chunk overlap o e r l zero okay and then what will happen so basically final document IFD is going to be TS dot uh ts. split documents and there I'll be just going to pass this dcx talks and then what will happen I'll be just going to this FD okay so let's see length of the FD let's see and hopefully this will be 10 total okay let's see okay so what I'll do now I don't know whether this will pick it up from here or not but let's try this thing okay yeah I got 10 documents see here okay and if you just want to actually print the all the document print X XX in FD it's a list right and we can simply write print XX so it is going to print all the documents one by one so let me again hit enter and see it is printing all the document one by one right like that this is one document this is one document see like this way this is printing all the document okay so basically we split split up everything now our final objective is actually uh to get the get this thing okay but before I do this thing here so what I'll do I'll just going to create a list like this I tell you why I'm doing this thing and now what will happen now I'll be going to call an open a API because every document from every document I'll be going to actually get the summary response equals to open ai. chat completion right do create okay and here I'll be just going to pass something like this so my model is actually going to be gp4 right GPT 4 right then what will happen I'll be going to pass the message right messages and this will be a list and inside that list what will happen I'll be just going to write so basically what I will write so I will write the role okay so the first role will be like this and it should be role okay what will be the role role will be the system s y s t m system and what will be the message or what will be the content okay okay so maybe I can just write uh you are you are a you are a helpful helpful intelligent AI assistant okay right so what will be the next thing next thing will be the system okay so something like this and here the role will be user okay and what is the content that is the most important part C TNT content and in the content I'll be going to instock it to do something right so basically I'll be going to use a F string okay so I can just write summarize the following paragraph g into bullet coins right this then sln sln sln sln right then it is just going to write this XX this XX is actually this one right so maybe I think this is done but why actually key value PR not allow within the this thing so basically up to this point is done okay let me check why actually this is G some error okay uh okay so basically this key value this is key value there role is user content is user okay but while actually up to into bullet points yeah I don't know why this is this part is actually giving error I don't know summarize the following into bullet points up to this point everything seems okay okay I just think okay so let me do one thing let me remove this part and see so this still it is giving me an error okay so basically I maybe I did something wrong somewhere okay so basically the wrong is here it should be key value pa okay and F string and bullet points and after that slash n SL n and xx okay everything is done right the prompt is developed everything is done then what I'll happen so basically up to this here so messages equals to uh we'll be going to actually write this response okay and maybe in the response uh okay so what we'll do we'll just print the response one by one let's see whether the response is actually coming or not that is the ultimate objective okay PR BS okay so I think there is no more prins there r s p o n spelling mistake is always a problem for me okay so let's do it so basically I'll be able to get all the response one by one okay so let's hit enter and let me check whether I'm getting all the response or not okay so this will take take some time this is going to create all the response one by one CU first it is generating single document and from there actually it is doing something here okay okay yeah First Response came okay so basically respond is actually part of this Choice inside the choice it is a list so zero element and after that we have something called message and inside the message contain so it should be something like this so okay so response like this c h o y c e s choices then it's a least zero okay and inside that we have to have something called message okay and in the message we have a key called body message and content okay so let me content I believe this will work so this is still working let's wait for some time because this will take some time because there are total 10 documents so we have to wait for some time okay let's wait let it run okay okay I'm still waiting this to be done yeah something is happening let's wait so guys if you don't want to watch this thing you can skip this part CU here I'm waiting uh for the execution to be completed so that I should not get any error like to token uh overused or out of token or or maybe like U iteration uh like timeout or token uh like overuse or something like that threshold is reached okay so that is I'm just running it and this video length is actually more than 1 hour 13 minutes so it's a very good like exercise to do it using recursive director text splitter so here actually you're using two three things uh two three things or maybe 1 2 3 four stream like streim late open a character recursive character text splitter and the document loader right so so many things are there okay okay so I believe uh this is done okay uh okay okay so let me actually uh run it from here again okay so I think it's done so maybe so let's execute this thing here and one more time okay so I just want to actually get the message nothing else okay okay so let's see whether I'm only going to get the message or not message means in the bullet form okay cuz I just need the bullet form here okay bullet points right when I a bullet point it's is actually going to come as a new line character I believe okay so it's is coming as a bullet point okay it's all right so what I'll do I'll just going to close everything this this and this I'll just going to close Okay I open a new terminal and maybe I can simply write MSG equals to this and this right all done then what will happen uh then what will happen we need to just format this thing right so I believe everything is coming and for every document see for every XX for every XX a bullet is generated and everything will be actually happen inside this list so l. append and we be going to happen using MSG read the message right and what happen once everything is done at the end of the for Loop means here we just write St dot right and I'll just simply write this a Leist right so do join and we just going to convert that list into a string so here I'm getting a list and after that I'm just converting that list into string and I'm just printing that inside the st. WR because st. WR takes a string as a parameter on okay so everything is done our job is done so we'll be just going to execute this thing and after that you see a nice looking app is ready and that app is actually intelligent enough to give you the summary of a YouTube of any YouTube video in the bullet form okay so maybe let's execute done so what will happen so maybe I'll just going to I don't know I don't know is it yeah it's taking okay so nothing is running so let's execute submit and let's wait here okay so hopefully it will give the uh answer after some time okay okay so let's wait hopefully this will take uh at least 3 minute 3 to 4 minute cuz there are total 10 documents are there and I believe every document is taking at least 20 second to 30 seconds so hopefully this overall thing is going to take at least uh 3 to 4 minute okay so okay okay let's wait okay let's wait and you will get the response here actually okay okay if you want there is something called you can just print this message just to make sure that everything is actually coming right so still working and nothing is coming here okay so let's wait we have to wait actually let me check if something is here or not yeah nothing came yet so still wait okay so just do one thing let me actually put this thing like this okay so something like that okay and maybe like this and I can actually what is this yeah like this and I can put this thing here okay so parallel two things okay so let's see let's wait can see let's s it there are a lot of things you can actually do if somebody's actually going to put an invalid thing it is actually should give you an error so if you see here so it's giving you the complete summary of everything right that's super cool right this is super cool so you see everything is coming like this great so hopefully you guys now got something to uh practice or maybe you can showcase something to your like client or maybe to your friends or to your family member like they will be super impressed by your like skills CU you just put a YouTube video video uh you just put an YouTube video URL and from the URL actually you are going to get that just uh out of it right and also it is coming in the nice looking documented for uh sorry bullet format so there won't be a problem right so if you have some multiple webinars or something and from there you can you want to create your own like uh thing some documentation and something like that you can easily do it right so this there's a field of this this field of AI is actually super powerful so you can actually do anything or everything with the help of this AI if your mind is actually uh like already aligned with uh some sort of like positive intention you are definitely going to do something for the mankind okay okay so enough of knowledge that sharing I don't want to actually put you guys in a uh uh kind of a boring or situation so rather than I'm just just going to conclude this video over here but I'm super excited to start this uh new kind of tutorial because till now whatever we are doing kind of a theoretical thing and here we started doing some sort of handson and I believe you guys will be um able to understand each and every concept whatever I actually shown in this video and if you see the codes code block is also very easy and super simple you can do anything or everything if you have the similar requirement you can actually try to do some or enhance something as well right so that's it I would like to conclude the video here and before I conclude the video guys it's a request uh
