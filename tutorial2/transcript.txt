[Music] [Music] what's up guys this is Ronnie welcome back to our Channel Total technology Zone and today's topic will be how to scrape any website using Lang chain so basically I'll be going to show you guys how to do web scrap using Lang Chain by writing two three lines of code okay so web scripting is a very important uh like factor for if you're coming from a freelance background or if you are working for some sort of like rag based application now what is Rag and those things I'll be going to discuss in the next tutorial because those things are very Advanced but for the Tim being I'll just show you guys how to actually uh get the link from anywhere and how to actually extract the meaningful information from that website because these things are actually going to be used in the later part of the series or the playlist so that is why I'm actually doing this now so suppose you got a link and from the link you want to actually get the information suppose it could be a a tutorial it could be like product review or maybe it could be a description of a product or maybe a news article or anything but you want to actually just get the information from the link automatically so maybe this is the way you can do it but again only information is actually not going to help us so basically with that information probably you can actually build your own large language model or maybe you can actually fit that into an existing large language model to uh do some sort of like uh sub question answering b or any intelligent uh like feedback system or whatever okay so for that purpose we need some sort of data so this is one of one of the ways actually to extract the data there could be another ways or multiple ways like getting data from website s API Call Etc but this is something like very straightforward and very widely used like you can actually get a URL you extract the data by scraping the website and after that you will keep the data somewhere by splitting indexing and vectorize in the vectorized form and after that whenever required you will pass that data into your llm and you will get the response okay so that is the ultimate rag but I'm not going to discuss the rag here okay but that will be discussed in the next tutorial or from the next tutorial onwards we'll be going to start working on the advanced part but in this tutorial be going to focus on how to scrape or how to do web scraping using Lang chain okay so let me move ahead to the next slide so basically to scrape any website we'll be going to require two module as syn chromium loader and HTML to text Transformer I'll be going to explain all this thing in detail in the next part and the part will be actually the coding part okay so what I'll do let me write down the coding here okay so maybe from lank chain okay dot uh document loaders import something s sync chromium loader and we'll be going to actually from one document Transformer okay lin. doent Transformer import HTML to text Transformer I'll be going use this tool okay so let's start working on this thing let's say URL is something okay right so it will be let's say loader equals to ASN chromium loader and it should be something like this okay in this format right then maybe docs equals to loader do load like this and maybe we can simply print this docs okay and here I'll be going to pass some sample URL so basically this a news channel sorry News website so let me put it here okay and let's see whether I'm getting any error or something like that okay okay let [Music] see okay so something is happening at the background okay so let's so it's a big uh like lengthy uh like not any large uh kind of a very long text based information are here so because of that it's taking time so let's wait okay okay so things are done so basically it is saying 3,000 Ms uh executed so because of that it's not working so let me try something maybe it's taking time because 3,000 millisecond is too much okay so lot of informations are available so sometime it will give this sort of error as well okay so let's wait for some time yeah if you see here you got the information here right so the simple thing how to get the actual information so basically docs like zero and after that you have to just write page content and if I do like this it is going to give me the meaningful information only okay okay let's see but it is not giving me the text information if you see it is actually coming up with the no text Bas informations are available like the information which actually available in the website that is coming along with that actually it is giving my HTML uh like source code actually okay so the actual information is actually embedded inside the HTML code I'm actually not interested about those code so how to actually pass that and how to get the only information we'll see in few minutes okay but let it actually get this page content actually okay yeah I got the information right so now what will happen I'll be going to use this HTML to text Transformer okay so basically text Transformer is going to be HTML to this Transformer like this and then what we'll do um so maybe uh transform or maybe final text or final document FD is equals to uh TT TT do transform documents and inside that I'll be going to pass this docs okay and after that I'll just going to like print FD okay and let's see how it is going to happen now so clear it and let's execute okay I'm just doing it with a big like kind of a little bit complex uh like website so because of that it is coming up sometimes uh like uh multiple text character or the characters or words are there so that is why it is sometimes going to show me this uh exceed okay so let's see let's wait okay I think now I got this information completely here so yeah so information are coming right so now what is actually going to happen so we'll be going to actually um convert this document and we'll try to actually get the summary of this thing okay so we can do that very easily let's do it okay a little bit complex thing so now I'm getting the information here but I want to actually get the um get the this thing like only the information part okay the main information part not anything extra kind of a summary of this page okay so let's see how to do that okay so to get the summary maybe uh we need to use some sort of recursive text splitter right so let's do it slowly slowly okay okay so what you have to do uh uh maybe we can just do we need to import open a okay because we need a summary in bullet okay so import L chain. text spitter okay write import so [Music] uh my import is show in this thing I don't know L chain text spitter okay import strange why this line is actually giving me err I don't know import Lang gen Dot text spitter [Music] import recursive correct t look I don't know why this is giving me error here so let me actually uh comment this line and check what is the error here it is saying okay so I actually forgot it should be from because of that the error is coming I'm so stupid sorry guys okay okay so now this is done okay so basically I convert this thing here and after that what is going to happen we need to actually uh split up this uh document uh using some sort of uh some sort of splitting okay so let's see how how to do this splitting so basically here I'll be going to create a text splitter okay and text splitter will be coming recursive character T spitter so one thing will be actually here chunk size CH chunk size so maybe I can use chunk size let's say let's say 2,000 chunk size okay and another will be chunk overlap okay chunk overlap maybe I can make it zero okay and then what will happen now so maybe I'm just thinking how to actually do this thing let's see uh this a final document so maybe this is not the final document then so maybe this is just going to be docs okay and it should be I let me actually cut this thing here and like this so whatever loaded do load is actually going to give me I'll be going to use that so something like this and then what will happen I'll be just going to create a FD and FD is going to actually TS dot um now we'll be going to do what ts. split document right because ultimately you have to split documents right and inside that I'll be just going to pass this TS okay that's it so once these things are done so maybe I can actually check how many documents are there so maybe I can just create length of FD just to check multiple documents are coming okay so let's clear it okay so see how web scrapping is actually being used here you'll understand now okay so let's wait okay so I thought this tutorial is going to take uh less time but it is taking a lot of time so basically okay so recursive character text splitter it is saying that recursive characters text spitter is not iterable so why such thing is showing I don't know let's see uh something different type of error I'm getting here so I'm getting this error here actually TS oh okay sorry I did a mistake it should be docs okay sorry it's my mistake it should be docs so see I first got the normal document here we transform HTML to text and after that I created a text spitter after that I'm using the text splitter with this docs and I'm getting this final document I'm just checking the length of the final document okay so let's see okay I thought this tutorial is going to be like maybe 5 10 minutes but I was wrong it took me maybe more than 20 minutes now and you never know like I actually started with the intention of only doing uh web scraping but it seems that it is taking like in a different way like it's taking a different type of like tutorial now so what exactly you're going to do with the webscraping I'm actually showing it here okay so you see there are total 16 so total 16 documents are there so maybe the what count will be here 32,000 or something like okay so I got this thing here so basically what will happen now so for XX in FD okay like this and now will be going to actually call the open AI to do the summarization okay so this is going to be very simple so basically what will happen now so we'll be going to write just response okay like this and what will happen open AI chat completion right do create okay like this okay and now what will happen we going to the first line we'll be going to write uh model like this so it should be GPT for like this okay next what will happen messages okay right okay so how we'll be going to uh incorporate this messages so basically with this thing so like this in the first line it will be like this role and contain so first it will be a role and the role will be actually system right and the content will be content what will be the content okay so content will be you are you are you are helpful you are a helpful intelligent assistant okay like this then let's go to the next line and and we'll do the next thing so it should be same thing so role role will be user and content will be so summarize so maybe I'll write something in a different way so summarize the following into bullet points okay right then slash in slash in right then what is actually going to happen we'll be just going to write down this thing called XX okay I believe everything is done here right no need to worry okay so like this everything is done now what will happen I'll be just going to write message equals [Music] to this response okay so let's see whether it is actually able to do it or not okay so I think uh response okay let's see okay so two three more iteration I'll be going to require so we'll do it accordingly okay so I have a website I'm trying to actually get the information out of the website using uh web scraping technique and the web scraping is actually done by Lang chain and after we get the information I converted that entire content from HTML to text and after that I'm converting uh the text um into multiple chunks and from the chunks I'm actually getting the summary as per the bullet points okay so that is the ultimate objective okay [Music] okay okay so this this this is going to take a little bit of time okay but I believe it is doing something because it's a total 16 documents so 16 time this Loop is actually going to execute okay so we have to wait okay ah I did a mistake actually uh I forgot to actually PR this response here okay so I supposed to do this thing okay let me actually close it here okay I'm closing it here and what I'm doing I'm trying to actually print the first response and after that I I want to stop it okay print response and after that I just want to stop it I will just forcefully exit s. exit like this and this is not required always but I'm just want to do it just to save some time okay so let's do it I just want to get the first response and after that I want to stop it see okay so it's giving me only one information if you see here okay so basically I just stop so basically I need the choices so basically it is response of choices okay so choices c y a c s choices and inside the choices I have a list and then from the list I need the first element so zero okay like this and within the choices I have something called dictionary called message so I just write [Music] message and message as a key call content so I just need that okay so what I'll do I'll just simply write this thing and let's see whether I'm getting this information correctly or not okay so let's execute [Music] [Music] for okay so I'm getting a timeout error so it's normal thing sometime we get timeout error so let's try to rewrite this thing again uh it is still giving me the same error okay so don't know what happen suddenly so let's try to do it again H few moments ago there is no error okay so suddenly it's giving me the error hopefully this time this should execute H again it is giving me the same error what happen suddenly don't know like few seconds ago everything was perfectly running now suddenly it's giving this error okay uh so error actually I believe ER that is actually coming here so let me check this thing print length of FD so basically I'm getting the error here actually in this part uh here loading the document okay okay so let's do it again one more time yeah so it is is only giving me one information so basically the thing is that we are getting error here so suddenly not sure what happened my Internet is slow or something because of that I'm not getting anything okay so let's wait for some time or else we could do something we can actually try to load something maybe I just load this thing okay so let's and let's try one more time okay okay it's not doing this is not working okay something very funny something was working like let's say 10 minutes ago and suddenly something stopped working okay so maybe I can try with some other link here so maybe I don't know maybe takech let go to the technology section and try to do something with this okay let's see whether it is able to grab something out of here okay yeah I think it's now working it seems okay so what I do I'll just try to actually do it for this link okay CU this link seems working okay and there are total six document if you see here so it's comparatively little bit smaller okay so let's try to work on this thing okay so what I'll do I'll just try to print each and every one one by one okay so or else you can actually print everything together at the end so L do append like this okay and this should be something to L with L with lank okay done okay let's do okay okay I think all our append are done now you have to just print this L okay so how to print this l so it should be like this do join and I would like to do it with just L I want to print as a string again okay okay so all done so let's see so that is how you can actually uh like scrap any website and get the summary of the information but this um this things are not working for normal loading we need to actually increase the timeout I'll see whether is there any option to actually increase the timeout or not so maybe uh just hold on so this uh what part this is actually giving the error will not understand so basically [Music] then okay okay we can just okay so it's working so let's [Music] wait okay so if you see here so everything's coming but some of the unwanted details are there right so basically what we'll do we'll try to actually improve the prompts there summarize the following in bullet points only consider meaning to sentences okay so I don't want to actually include this menu items and all okay so let's do it now one more time okay for okay okay so I will I will try one more iteration with the actual link and after that maybe I'll just close it okay maybe we try to some other web page let's see okay so I give the prompt but still it is actually giving me this thing so maybe meaningful [Music] sentences this ignore also ignore [Music] all headings and uh [Music] un un lesser important all headings and words words let's see I don't know whether this is going to make any sense or not I'm just trying okay uh now for this website also it is giving me 3,000 error okay this is funny so maybe I believe there is some time limit to use the tokens if it is coming with six then it's fine if it is coming with one then definitely there is an error okay six it means it is going to coming something total six documents are coming let's see I'll just try out this thing and another link after that that's it okay so now I think uh little bit meaningful information all came that's it Bingo okay so I'll try to do this thing with another website so basically this one so question answer with rack it's a lang chain documentation so I'll be going to start rack in the next tutorial just to set the context maybe I actually use this link okay so let's see okay okay let's see how to do it okay let [Music] me okay okay okay let's try out this thing okay let's see so three three documents are already available if you see I got okay so this is super easy now you guys understood and definitely I'll be going to get some context from every website so now if your requirement is actually do we scraping you can do it easily using three lines of code okay so see so many information I got is here okay right so last time maybe what I can do I can actually try out this link one more time and let's see whether I'm getting something or it is still giving me 3,000 error okay okay let's see okay yeah so it's a timeout error always so let's not actually try this out so if it is a like the link is actually a little bit longer then probably it is going to give some error so maybe I don't know like how to actually set this thing up let's see uh maybe uh [Music] link I don't know time might error why is giving the time out maybe something will be there definitely okay we can actually check this thing uh how to set the timeout exitting the timeout limit of 3,000 Ms okay okay so but before I actually conclude this video here so guys we'll we'll try to actually look into this asnc chromium loader function uh like um that maybe I'll will do it offline and maybe I'll upload you in my next video how to actually load a big website or big web page but it seems it is uh not working here at least uh it's giving me some sort of timeout error so we'll try to fix it and let you know okay okay so before I conclude this video I'd like to request you guys uh please try to subscribe to our Channel if you're new to our uh Channel if you see this is the tutorial number 31 and before that we already uh uploaded more than 30 tutorials so if you have any aspiration to do something in the AI space or if you want to uh if you want to become a developer AI developer or want to do something in the area of large language model or nlm so definitely this tutorial is actually going to help you and if you are already started working or if you need some sort of help probably our playlist are actually going to help you okay so it's an it's a humble request guys please try to subscribe to our Channel because we' like to reach to the larger audience base and that is our goal right and your your one subscription or your one subscriber uh from anywhere is actually going to motivate Us big time so it's a request try to subscribe to our Channel and hit the like button subscribe sorry hit the like button and also try to share our videos with your family friend and if you think somebody is going to help from our video just try to share the video with them as well okay and last but not least uh don't just watch our video with the watch just try to parall practice the coding because ultimately coding is the ultimate objective to become a better developer and the expert developer if you start writing The Code by your own you see you will gain confidence and with the confidence you will get additional like expertise right and hopefully that will help you to become a better developer in the future right so that is why it's a recommendation don't just watch my videos with the watching parall you can actually try to write down the code the same way I actually did this thing right and if you come across some sort of new use case or something uh uh something you want to actually discuss where you are not getting any uh like Breakthrough or success like developing or in the implementation just let us know we try to actually help you or if something is in if something is a little bit bigger than the help maybe I can actually try to create a video so that it will be helpful for everyone okay so that's it guys we'll see you in the next video till then take care goodbye and have a nice [Music] day
