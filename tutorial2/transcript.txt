[Music] [Music] this is Ronnie welcome back to our Channel Total technology Zone this is tutorial 51 and today's topic will be AWS GPT to perform any task on AWS so AWS GPT is not a tool which is available which is developed by any open source communi it's it's just a custom name I have given so uh it is kind of I developed something just for fun to give you guys some sort of insight uh on Lang chain custom tools or agents right so probably uh um uh Let me refresh this in a different way so I actually develop a set of Custom Tool which is actually going to help you to do some operation on AWS and altogether I'm calling you as AWS gbd okay so don't think that there is some tool available in in open source Community or Forum so you can go ahead and search with like Google search or somewhere won't get anything right so basically I just created uh just created this thing kind of giving you guys some sort of like U like fun and interactive way of learning uh Lang chain custom agents and Tool okay so what exactly we're going to do here so create and read S3 buckets from AWS using Lang L chain so using Lang chain okay and L chain and obviously open a okay so we'll use langin Custom Tool okay so this are the prerequisite B 3 you have to install and you have to configure AWS so set up your access ID and secret here I have already done the steps like if you are if you're not familiar with this thing probably you can just go ahead and search this things from the Google or Internet they will tell you and this is the slide where you will get the source code link of this thing so now I'll be just going to stop the slides show and I'll just start doing everything from the Practical standpoint okay so basically if you see these are my S3 buckets created and let me go to chat GPT so first let me explain the problem and then probably I'll be going to tell you what exactly I'm going to do so maybe if you want to know that how many buckets are there in your S3 bucket okay so can you tell me how what uh or can you write down all the bucket names from my dat okay so I can't directly interact with in external system right so if you have the AWS command line interface this is going to tell you that if you do this thing this is going to tell you right now let's suppose uh you are not a technical person or you don't want to do this much of activity right so you just need something like like in UI you will write something in a natural language and it will uh read that and it will directly interact with your S3 bucket or your AWS account how to do that so basically uh that is the thing I am actually going to develop here and I'll be going to show you and then you will understand what is the power of llm and the L chain framework okay so without uh like uh wasting further let's start uh start actually working with the code Okay so let me open my Jupiter notebook sorry it's not a jupyter notebook it's a vs code okay so let's start writing the code okay so first thing we'll be going to actually import the main modules basically uh we'll be going to uh use from L chain okay just hold on maybe let it bit bigger okay so from L chain uh open AI import chat open a like this is the first and then we we going to import the Lang chain agent so from from Lang chain uh L chain what is that agent okay L chain dot agent in so basically we'll have something called initialize agent initialize agent and we have to use something called Agent type okay so then I'll be going to import the tools from Lang chain okay dot tools import tool okay so then I'll be just going to create a stream Lei so let see from import import stream lead s and last but not least we have to import the b key so import one to three okay so that's it everything is created so first we'll be going to uh create an what I say so let me actually create an llm okay so let me start a llm here actually so basically my llm is actually going to be chat chat open AI right then model is going to GPT 4 yeah obviously I'm using a premium model and it's chargeable because I'm like doing uh some some some sort of like customization always and it is better to use some paid model right okay so this is done then another initialization so let me create something called client and it is going to be B 3. client so all operations are going to be with S3 so just S3 and S3 is a global uh ser but you have to actually initialize the client with the region name or it is going to give you some error so region name and what I do I just going to write us hen East hyen one right so if you're going to create S3 bucket creation then it is required that your client should be like parameterized with this value for reading it is not required but for writing or creation it is obviously required right so now what we'll do we'll be just going to initialize our streamly do set uh set page config uh set page config so basically what exactly we'll be going to do we'll be going to write something called page title so maybe I just write AWS what is this AWS GPT okay something like this okay so then I'll be just going to write st. header okay so in the header what we'll be going to write so we'll be going to write uh ask anything related aw okay uh so basically in this tutorial I'll just going to show you guys on how to read from S3 how to read what are the S3 buckets are there and how to create S3 bucket but you can make you can make this thing more mature so that it can actually do anything or everything related to AWS it is obviously possible because underlying thing is B 3 I'll be going to create multiple Custom Tool with the help for B 3 so basically if B 3 libraries are all all all all like bits and pieces are there in the B 3 library right for all services so technically you can do anything and everything right so it is done now we need an input so basically input is actually going to be St do text input and there will'll be going to write uh what you want to want two okay this is done hopefully let me execute this thing with new terminal so basically it should be stream stream lit uh run so basically it will open this thing yeah and the title is AWS GPT so uh like the um like base uh like structure for UI is actually created okay so let's start accordingly so now what we'll do we just kill the terminal okay and basically clear everything okay so now what we'll do uh let's start actually doing the next part so basically first uh we'll be going to create couple of tool okay so first tool will be uh get S3 S3 just bucket name okay so basically I would like to get some S3 bucket L inut is going to be there uh this so basically how to get the bucket probably you can just write bucket is going to be this client do listor pt list buckets okay okay so then let's do print bucket okay now what you do I'll just try to run this function and see what I'm getting so basically get bucket name I'll just passing something like it's just um nothing to worry it is just going to take a dummy string and do it so I just want to know it is going to give me the bucket names or not okay so let's see it is running so let's see so so I don't know why it is taking some time ideally should not take that much of time but let's wait okay so this taking time I don't know why this is taking time so H so let's wait for some more time okay so kill the terminal again and let's execute one more time terminal new terminal so basically uh let's execute yeah okay so I got this information so here so basically everything is actually part of this thing called buckets okay so basically something called bucket so let's see okay so basically it's a list and in the list every name is actually part of this dictionary so basically uh what I can do I can simply write buckets equals to this so basically uh we can simply write this okay so let me write this thing command C so basically I don't need this one anymore so buckets now what we will do for bucket in bucket right then print bucket and I to get the name so basically from this name so basically like this and let's see okay all three names are coming right so basically what I can do here I just create a dummy list something like this and after that I'll just append that name do append like this this okay name start happen like this and at the end what I'll do I'll just going to print that so basically print of names right so let's see whether I'm getting a list or not okay I'm getting a list so basically for function it is going to be I don't need this thing so rather than I just going to return this thing return right so my first function is ready right so my first function is ready for the tool so basically uh what you'll do now uh I'll just going to create another tool which is actually going to uh create uh the bucket okay so this is for reading the bucket now I'll be going to do something which is going to create the bucket so what I'll do I'll just going to uh write def okay so create S3 bucket right and here also just going to CL input and what it'll do uh everything is will be same right so basically uh the response is going to be let's say client dot creatore bucket right and there in the bucket I'll be just going to pass a bucket name right so basically b c k e is going to be inut so our LM is automatically going to pass and send the name from the input okay and now what we'll do uh I'll be just going to uh create something but let's see let's actually try this thing here so basically uh what I'll do okay so let's try something so let's call this function first create bucket and there I'll be just going to pass some name so a b c then test then Hy 2024 then lmm okay so basically what you'll do it is going to print the response okay so now what we'll do I'll just go and show you here uh I have this only three buckets are there right so let's see this bucket will be created after I execute this thing okay okay so if you see this bucket is created ABC test and basically it is coming with this HTTP status code right so what I'll do so response metadata and this HTTP status for first check whether I really get this thing or not okay yes it is created right so all fine so basically I'll just write this okay this and HTP status code Okay and like this right so basically what it'll do now data right so basically I can say WR if data equals to equals to 200 then return access created okay else return failed to create okay so all done so now all this tools are ready for me this tools are actually I mean this functions are ready now what you'll do I'll be just going to create the tool right so first first tool I'll be just going to give a name S3 name I'll just going to give a name S3 name so S3 name is actually going to be created with this instance of this tool and this is going to have couple of for parameter like name function description so let's write this names first like name I have to give a name for this tool okay so name is very important so basically I'll just give a name I'm just thinking okay so let's give a name bucket name names okay right then function what function are we going to use so Funk is going to be this function name okay so when uh when any bucket name related activities are required it is going to call this F okay and this is not a string this is going to be like this remember okay or else it is never going to work so now main important thing description description should be s explanatory so the llm should understand so basically I'll be going to write use to get uh F3 bucket names okay from from uh bucket names maybe just to reduce the typo I can just simply write bucket names names using bucket name Tool okay so this is done so now I have to create another tool which is going to use this thing right okay here I just to should be response okay done so S3 what should I give name S3 create okay so basically here the tool name I have to give a name so maybe I can give bucket create okay okay so here it should be this one okay right now description I have to write a description okay what is this okay used to create S3 bucket used to create S3 bucket bucket using uh using bucket create tool bucket create Tool uh to as part the input name input name provided by the enger As for the input name provided for F3 bucket by the inder okay this is done now you have to create a variable this a list variable tools and this is going to be S3 name S3 create then now what you'll do we'll be just going to create an variable Called Agent so agent is going to be initialize agent so first will be llm then okay first will be tools actually so tools okay tools llm right next thing will be agent underscore type so agent type will be agent type do okay so it should be zero short react description zero okay I don't know why this is not coming underscore react underscore description zero short react description right and the verb was equals to [Laughter] True okay okay so this is done now what we'll do we'll be just going to check uh the buttons so if St do button means if the button is submitted button is there and button actually pressed so basically just write submit submit and then uh type equals to primary right then I have to check if input is not blank if input is not okay then what is actually going to happen response equals to agent dot run okay like this okay and then s do WR equals to response Okay Okay cool so I believe everything is fine there should not be any error so let's actually start working with the code so first thing first let's clear this thing okay so everything is fine okay so let's start with stream late run main. F so it is opening here right so what I'll do I'll be just going to ask him how many buckets are there I have total four and it should give me the bucket name so uh write down the bucket names from my AWS okay so let's see let's see here what it is doing okay so it is doing something okay so it is saying that it is going to use this thing and it's easily able to see here it is actually able to do get this thing easily right and let's see in the what is coming in the UI so the bucket names from your AWS are this this this this super cool okay I'm actually Amazed by the by the operation though I develop this thing but still I'm amazed like I send something like this so underlying open llm is so so much powerful so it understood like what operation it has to be used so there are total two tools two tools are there right we have total uh one tool and second tool so it's automatically understand it has to use this tool now the next critical operation right so we have four buckets so now I'll ask him to actually create a bucket okay uh create a bucket where bucket name is sample lag llm for test 2024 okay so let's see okay so let's see which okay it is see it is using this operation only bucket create okay so it's done the bucket name has been successfully created right so now let's see whether it is really created or not so let's refresh the page oh my God it's created sample rag llm test see super cool so let's ask the another question so same question list down all my bucket names right it's doing yes it's came here he'll come now yes 1 2 3 4 5 super cool I'm am missed by the the like operation so basically you can uh you can create very powerful AWS GPT with the help of this open llm and Lang chain okay so my goal or intention is actually to enhance this board and to commercialize this thing so probably if someone is interested to work with me so probably you can join me uh we can uh work together and we can create something for the future obviously uh it will be a open source project and uh initially um don't expect for any like financial support it's just for learning or just for like just just to actually help the community right okay so okay with that note I'll be just going to conclude the video over here hopefully you guys are enjoying my playlist so basically I have posted almost over 50 videos so this is a 51 tutorial if someone is actually watching our playlist for the first time please try to subscribe to our Channel hit the like button share our videos with your family and friend because um your one share actually going to help us to reach large number of audience B and our ultimate objective is actually to reach large number of people so that YouTube algorithm can boost our video right so it's a humble and personal request guys please help us to grow and I'm I'm promising you that I'll try to upload more and more like um interactive and fun and useful videos for the future as well okay so with that note I'll be just going to conclude the video here we'll be going to upload more videos in the coming days till then take care goodbye have a nice day and happy [Music] learning
