[Music] [Music] what's up guys this is Ronnie welcome back to our Channel Total technology Zone this is tutorial 62 and today's topic will be how to create an stream late app or UI driven app which will help you to generate Cloud AR architecture diagram with the help of Lang chain and open llm it means we'll be going to create an app obviously it will be UI driven app and in the app user will uh user will write something let's say user wants to have an infrastructure which will contain maybe two easy to instance one is3 bucket and maybe some of other things so once user hits the enter button it will create an architecture diagram right so B basically if you're working on a large scale project and where you have to actually draw multiple architecture diagrams so diagrams are time taking maybe sometimes it will take the entire day so if you have something handy like Al AI driven which can do or which can draw the diagram accurately then this is the service so with this uh with this um service or with this application you can actually uh reduce the overall time period for your architecture diagram and this will obviously going to reduce the time for any uh project execution life cycle right so obviously this will help help all the architecture around here and also all the architects around here and also if you are working for a project and where you have to Showcase some diagram to your client so this is the service you can use it okay obviously this is kind of a um this is kind of a learning objective or learning initiative so I will teach you guys how you can develop this sort of things and after that you have ample scope um there you can actually apply your own thought and you can try to extend this uh small intution to a large scale uh like project okay so with that note let me actually go ahead with the next slide what exactly we are going to do I'll discuss there so create an extremely to generate Cloud architecture diagram so basically there will be one streamly app and also there will be a box to enter some input and there will be a a submit button the moment you hit the submit button it will draw the diagram for you and also the code will be available into this links not much to discuss on the theory part let's start working on the coding part okay so this is my vs code okay here I created The Prompt okay and here couple of question will be going to us we server running on E2 instance so and so forth now before doing anything so what exactly I'm going doing using it here so basically uh there is a service called diagrams okay so basically this diagram will create any sort of diagram with help of python code so basically what I will use here I'll be going to use the open LM so open llm will read my uh natural language and convert that into a into a python code okay this code with the help of this diagram utility and after that my code will automatically execute this code it will convert uh the code into a diagram and after that the diagram will be rendered into the UI so lot of things we be going to do it will be very exciting so um if I just explain this thing from the theory maybe you won't be able to understand so let's start working on the coding part okay okay so first thing first we'll be going to uh require couple of uh couple of uh things okay so first thing first from from Lang chain okay underscore openi import Chad openi obviously uh you don't need to uh do anything related to this thing but you have to actually install this thing so it is so basically you have to install these things in your system first you have to install this diagram and after that you have to install this graph base okay because uh uh this sort of codes will be executed by open a or your or your uh like intermediate step so basically that time you will get an error so you have to just import this libraries sorry you have to just install this libraries like diagram and grab this okay and after that you don't have to do anything okay so let me go here right this is done then we'll be going to import from from L chain L chain do prompts so it will be chat prom template import chat prom template okay next thing will be uh llm chain so from Lang chain uh dot chain import llm chain okay last thing I will be going to import uh couple of more thing import OS IO and glob okay this module will be required to actually work with the local directory file okay so what is this yes okay and last thing will be stream l so import stream L as St so what I'll do first first we'll be going to create this thing like streamly title so it will be St do title okay here I'll be just going to write Cloud um architecture C architecture diagram tab okay then we'll be going to write St do write and there I'll be going to write um create in diagram of your Choice okay that's it now we'll be going to ask uh input will be St do text area right and there will be going to ask uh ask anything about your task okay done so these things are done now we'll be going to create what we'll be going to create at template string TS so prom template I just write it here your job is to write python code using drram module to generate Cloud architecture diagram right for steps okay informations only for steps information only like don't use any other information only generate the C as output nothing extra for reference use below to import elb in the code always I just giving some example okay that's it so let's copy this thing and put it here okay before I actually finalize the template I obviously use multiple hidden TRS and after that I understand that this is the form is most effectively used okay so this is done then I'll be going to create prom template so prom template will be chat from template okay right from template from template so and inside that what will be going to write we'll be just going to write TS right all done right the next thing is what llm so llm is equals to chat open AI okay like this then llm equals to llm right and then our model uh sorry I just did a mistake so basically model equals to uh GPT GPT hyen 4 H turbo right gb4 turbo and temperature I'll be just going to put a temperature here uh temperature is 0.0 done right so now we'll be going to establish one variable called qore Chen okay so what is actually going to happen llm Chen right llm Chen so and llm equals to llm right okay and then prompt p r m PT prompt prompt equals to what prompt equals to PT this prompt equals to PT done okay so next thing what um next thing is actually everything is set here template is done input is done now I'll be going to check whether input is having any value or not so basically it will be if input is not none right if input is not none then it will actually initialize a bet button so it should be bitan equals to St do button okay and the button will be a submit button so s m my submit button right it is done now what will AC if BN like this if button is clicked then what will happen actually so if button is Click so it is going to uh get a response response is actually QA chain do invoke and inside that I'll be just going to create a dictionary so in the dictionary the steps this variable steps STS steps are actually going to get the value from this variable input right done then basically what we'll do we just going to print response of text okay nothing else okay and we're just going to display this in the UI st. text and I think uh it is not required here so data equals to this this and I'll just going to do it here so I'm just trying to get whether I'm getting the actual code or not that is my objective okay so let's do what let's execute this thing first new terminal so basically now what will happen we'll be going to write a stream lit run main.py right it is going to generate something okay right so what I'll do I'll have a question here okay so let's going to ask this question first and see I'm able to get the actual code or not okay I'm getting the code let's wait and see I'm getting the uh code here or not okay so let's wait okay I got the code so basically this is a code and see whether from this code it is able to generate the diagram for not so what I'll do I'll just create test.py just to check whether the diagram is okay or not right so test.py so obviously this is the code if you say her I just copy the code from here okay and let's execute this code here okay so basically let me execute this test.py so if I execute this Pi so web server architecture. PNG file will be created here right now nothing is there so let's execute so you see uh I executed something I don't know what is this okay let's delete everything and let's try to execute this code okay okay you see it is created and this is the diagram right this is a diagram created okay here fine load balancer web server so everything is fine so I will just delete this thing I don't require I delete this python file I don't require here so now we have to do some tweak here okay so if you see here I'm getting the code I need to remove this and this means I need to remove the word Python and need to remove this back T right so let's do it first okay remove everything so code equals to data do replace okay so first thing you have to replace by python the what Python and it will be replaced by nothing and next thing again going to uh copy this thing right and let's see and here it will be going to write so the value is actually now inside the code so code is actually going to be replac this back takes so like this of this this back this will be replac by nothing right all are fine so this is my final code so once these things are done so what I will do I'll be just going to write the code inside a python file right so what we'll do uh I'll be just going to write uh with io. openen right and I'll just write Cod sample. py right Cod sample. py and it will be written in right mode right and encoding equals to UTF 5 and 8 okay as F1 right done and then what will happen f1. WR and inside that I will just write the value of code right nothing else and then we just going to write f1. close okay all done right I have no problem at all okay okay now if I execute this thing it should going to uh create a file uh so you have to execute this thing so it should be os. system okay system and inside that I'll be just going to write a command so it should be python Cod sample. py python then I'll be just going to write code sample. py so let's see up to this point what will happen and you should have a PNG file here okay so what I'm doing I'm telling you first with the help of llm I'm getting the code here after that I'm replacing some extra thing from the code and after that with the code I just create a python file and after that I'm executing the python file to generate the image here so let's execute this thing again okay so stream lit run men. py right done and what will happen we'll delete this thing we'll get the question from here okay and we should get a PNG file here remember right now it has no PNG file so it will be having in few minutes here paste and execute so it is running running running running running let's see let's see let's see let's see okay okay so see what we server architecture see right so I'm able to get the file execution and everything is completed okay so now my ultimate job is actually to display that photo in the uh UI but the problem is actually every time somebody is using this code a new photo is created so basically I have to delete the existing photo first before doing this things so what I'll do here what I'll do I'll be just going to write CWD equals to OS do get current working directory write this then after that what we'll do I'll be going to write files every PNG file I'll be going to write so it should be glob do glob glob module I explain long back so guys if you are watching this uh video for the first time so this is the 602 tutorial before that I already uploaded more than 60 61 tutorial so in that tutorial it's a playlist actually so one of the tutorial I explain the uses of this glob module okay so please try to watch this thing those things are very essential okay so glob do glob and after that I'll just write C WD then this then this then this okay and actually uh just hold on okay basically it should be like this and then star.png okay and then for file in files and then W do remove right file so I'm removing all the files okay okay means before it generates the new file it will delete the old file and after that what will happen it will be going to check the file again okay I'll be going to run this thing again okay okay and now I will see if length of files equals to equals to one only then only it will do st. image of file right that's it so everything is fine so basically I'm deleting the things and after that I'm after I execute the python code it will check if I have any PNG file is there if the count of PNG file is only one then only it will be visible or displayed or rendered in the Dy right everything is done cool right so let's go here and now we'll see the diagram here okay so let's see I executed this thing let's wait okay it's still running here oh my God it came right so simple images came now I'll be going to try with some other image okay so let's go to the question and let's do a little bit complex okay uh let's ask this question now so four instances e to instan all created from Autos scaling group three on them uh running one we W and one of them hosting RDS database okay so let's see let's try to generate this thing so still it is running the code okay okay so this will take some time maybe half a second uh maybe 2 seconds 3 second I don't know okay so it's giving some error okay so file name uh okay so what is the problem maybe it will come here and display the her here okay so okay F not no search directory C user one drive documents okay okay no such file or directory C users welcome server PNG okay so hm so basically it is not able to find this image here okay so just hold on [Music] um err are opening uh see user welcome documents web server architecture. PNG so basically [Music] uh okay so let's go to the code sample in the code sample it is saying Cloud architecture right but here uh glo. glob CWD PNG okay so where is the problem I have to understand the problem first okay first let's go let's go okay um uncut exception okay uh nine number 388 uh okay okay so I don't know which line actually I'm getting this error H so very strange so my file is created it's able to read the file length of files equals to glo. GL PNG everything is fine um let me check something uh if if I'm able to get this thing here or not let's see first okay let's forget about everything okay let's fix this thing first okay now I came here so my objective is actually to get a list and with the list it should uh replicate This Cloud okay okay Cloud architecture. PNG came I have no problem right now I believe yes Bingo it's working no problem okay so now let's try to actually make it um for E to inst created Autos scaling group three of them uh let's ask something a little bit different okay uh three of them running uh okay let's ask something different um uh uh we have a we have one we have one Lambda function created so whenever one E1 one new ec2 instance gets created Lambda will send email using SNF okay let's see so some random thing I said Okay so let's see how it is going to do it now so This Cloud architecture should change and it will give something different okay again it is showing Cloud architecture but let's see what is the image now okay easy to install Lambda function is topic right okay so very cool so whatever is your objective it is able to create this thing I'm I'm super excited so guys this is just a beginning if you have the time and if you have the thought process to do something bigger with the help of this thing try to make this uh like tutorial commercialized like it a ample scope and trust me guys over the period of 6 month or 10 months you will see someone created an automated service and that service can be commercialized uh to make some large amount of money with the help of this simple thing right but I have no time for this thing right now and even I don't have a team if you are if someone of someone is interested or some of you are interested or group of friends are actually interested you can collab with me and we can try something Innovative for the future right so uh so so I think I can conclude the video over here but before I conclude I would like to uh say a couple of things first thing guys uh don't just stop here but after watching the video you should try something by your own so that you can extend this tutorial with your own knowledge maybe you can try something different and try to uh write your own code by your own code own basically what I'm trying to say that don't just rely on my code like after doing this thing watching the video try to practice something by your own hand and try to write the code so until and unless you are not writing the code you won't get any confidence and last thing it's my personal request and I would like to um ask you guys few support guys I'm uploading uh regular videos on artificial intelligence and llm and if you see my videos are not theoretical videos every video is actually kind of directing to a real do use case and those use case are not actually going to solve any uh like college or student related problem basically all these problems are uh focused on some business specific use case right so I'm actually requesting you guys to please subscribe to my channel hit the like button share my videos with your friend and family member and also try to help me to reach large number of audience I would like to grow my audience base cuz until and unless I um grow my audience Bas YouTube videos YouTube actually not promoting my channel and only um way is actually via your help so guys please help me to reach large number of audience it will actually help me to do something good in my own personal uh point of view as well so that um your own subscription or your own share will motivate me to come back harder with some uh large uh not large some better quality content okay so please please please help me to grow guys it's a request okay so with that aspect I'll be just going to conclude the video here we'll see you in the next video till then take care goodbye have a nice day and happy learning [Music]
