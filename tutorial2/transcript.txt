[Music] [Music] what's up guys this is Ronnie welcome back to our Channel Total technology Zone this is tutorial 2 and today's topic will be how to convert BGR images into grayscale images using open CB Okay so so in the last tutorial we have seen how to read an image file and how to write back into another image uh uh into another file uh using open CV and that time we understood that uh by default open CV uh does everything into BG image format like blue green red okay and in this tutorial we will learn how to convert an U PNG file into a gray scale image right and after that how to write it back into a another image file into new image file as a b as a gray scale image okay so that is the ultimate thing for this tutorial okay so one more thing I want to reiterate over here that this is the beginning of this playlist right you can see only this is the second tutorial and in this tutorial I'll try to um like cover as much as the fundamental concept like at the beginning I'll try to uh I'll try to touch Bas upon all the fundamental basic building blocks of open CV 5 and after that in the maybe after completing 15 or 20 tutorials we'll try to start building some real world use cases and that time we going to integrate all these bits and pieces into a bigger component right to understand those bigger component and Concepts uh in a better way or efficient way I just want to uh do this handson with this basic uh like components or fundamental components so that is why you will see at the beginning the tutorial are very uh like um very very basic and very small and precise tutorial but slowly slowly uh we will gradually moves towards the intermediate complexity and later on we'll be going to move towards the advanced complexity okay this tutal we'll learn how to convert BG like BG into gra scale okay so first use case will be read PNG file as a gray scale we'll be definitely going to use the same I am read function then we'll be going to write back uh the same image file as a gray scale image okay and here also we'll be going to2 image function and also we'll be going to use some uh flag so let's see how we are going to do it okay so I have one PNG file here we'll try to read things as a scale so let's see okay so it should be import CB2 okay then let's say input equals to CV2 dot I am I am read okay and here I'll be going to copy the path okay and we just mention CB2 do I am read gra scale okay that's it okay and going to print this input okay there is one interesting thing I'll show you guys okay so this is the thing okay now what will happen now um this is um this is the input image now what we'll do we'll be going to write back the same image as a gr scale okay so here we completed this thing so now output equals to CB2 do IM right okay and here we'll be going to like okay so if you see if I U write I am right over here and after that we can put some file name here okay what file name I can write I can easily write output PNG okay and let's see okay so first it will read and here it will be created an output file so this is my original file remember but I want to write it back write it actually uh I want to write back it as an G SK okay so I forgot to give this in put thing sorry okay so this is the fin name and this is the image okay this is done see this is the gr scale image so just now we converted an B original image into scale image okay so this is the ultimate objective of this tutorial okay so now now um one of you actually requested me that uh how to how to actually read multiple files okay so for reading multiple files things are very easy so let's say um you have you have multiple P files okay you have to just iterate over using a for Loop okay next important thing is uh could be um we'll be going to start working on some sort of like other file format okay but for the time being uh just try to understand if you have a uh if you have a uh gr scale image you can easily convert that image into BGR image okay so now uh next thing I just want to see I have this gray scale image now how to actually uh convert that into a bgl that also we'll be going to understand so let's see whether I'm able to do it or not okay so just uh comment this line and let's say input equals to CV2 do IM read okay IM read here what I'll do I'll be just going to uh copy this file copy P okay I'm just going to put it here okay and I can just write C2 im2 so there is something I am read underscore uh this this should be something like uh I just want to understand how to convert that from gra scale to BG right I'm just thinking why is not there okay color okay I am R has only this many this thing okay hold on let me think about it because uh I I think uh there something uh what was that just give me a moment guys let me my uh let me see my documentation okay so just give me some time uh okay to um all I think I think this is the thing this will make this thing let me okay I'm reading this thing now what we do we be going to create an output okay here what it do CB2 by default actually yeah so I am right okay and here what we do I'll be just going to create new file output 1.png and there I'll be just going to mention this as an input let's see how it is going to work okay okay now good thing is important thing is see now you have to understand one thing that is what I want to tell you see this image already lost is original color original color is actually this one right I converted that as a gray scale so when it is actually uh converted into gray scale it LO it actually it has been lost uh its original color right so it is not like that if you convert a gray scale image in the backend of the image it will keep a track of something no image has no memory I mean yeah definitely image has some memory but that memory is not that memory type of memory like where it can remembers what was the previous state or previous color right cuz I got so many that convert that BG image to G scale it is giving us black and white shade now if I want to get it back the original image how to do that so that is not possible okay so uh what what else I can do so what I can do I can like this and here I can also write this own us the original okay and this will convert it into gra scale now you can tell me why then this is for what this is to actually this is by default if you don't give it then also it is going to give you this color format okay right okay so next thing uh what next thing actually I want to show you this is my Pi okay copy this pick okay and I want to show you like what will happen if you give this thing okay so let's copy this thing here okay and let's minimize Let's ignore this part okay let's copy this pick okay and see what is going to happen Okay so if you do this thing what will happen this is actually going to convert that image into this is already a BGR image but this is still going to read it as a BG image this time I'll be going to get it the original as original C okay so this is the if you this thing then also it is going to give you the BGR format if you don't give this is also going to give you the BG format okay so you have to remember this thing okay okay so that's it that is what I want to um make you understand one you can easily into as see this is going to give you the conversion here okay so I haven't talked about t file format so in the next tutorial hopefully we can talk about TI file format okay I'm just uncommenting this code so whenever you guys are going to uh do it uh from your practice after watching this video please try to uh watch the video and understand the code parall or else you might think I'm using this same variable as well okay but this is not the same variable while you see when I was executing I was actually commenting the previous line okay so this things are little bit confusing at the beginning but trust me guys if you understand this conversion techniques uh like very well then probably it won't be a problem for you in the later on whenever we are going to develop some computer vision application okay so that's it guys that's it for today I'll be going to conclude the video over here before I conclude if you are watching this uh video for the first time thank you very much for watching this video hopefully we'll learn and understand so many um valuable things in your uh near future from my channel and I I'm hopeful that I'll be able to uh I'm able to add some value towards your uh like Learning Journey right so please try to help me as well try to hit the uh subscribe button try to uh like the video put some comment good or bad doesn't matter try to put some honest feedback so that YouTube will find this video and other people will find this video helpful and also this will help me to uh like crack the YouTube algorithm as well so please help me get some push from the YouTube algorithm so that I can reach the large number of audience so this is the honest and humble request from my side please help me guys I need your help and support to grow okay so enough of talking and requests let's conclude the video over here we'll see you in the next video till then take care goodbye have a nice day and happy learning oh [Music]
