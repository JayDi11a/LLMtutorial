what's up guys this is Ronnie welcome back to our Channel Total technology Zone this is tutorial 122 and today's topic will be how to convert web search results into NE for Knowledge Graph using langen Okay suppose you have a topic which you want to search from the internet and you want to create a knowledge C directly from those uh like U from those written content from the web search or internet search right let's say suppose you want to search about an article or maybe some news and everything you want to do it automatically like you will just write a query I mean the question it will search in the internet and it will generate the knowledge graph into NE for okay so let's start working that thing okay first thing what we'll do we'll be going to write here new 4J sandbox first we'll write this thing here so this is the sandbox for NE 4J okay sandbox. NE 4j.com it came here right now first we'll create a sandb box let it complete okay so here I'll just go down and I'll create a blank stand box and my credentials are downloaded okay yeah so what I'll do I'll just open it and what I'll do I'll just going to copy this thing okay copy and I will just put it into this EnV file okay and next thing for search I'll be going to use this one this website this is T search and you have to go here to sign up and after that you will get an API key you have to copy that API key and you have to put it in this file and don't worry guys after the tutorial I delete everything so don't worry that I'm just going to continue with this thing okay for envirment is set up right now what we will do I will go here and I will it's a blank sand boox I can open it okay I show you guys that there is nothing okay okay okay so let's use user ID password like this and I'll go here and I will copy the password from here okay okay is getting downloaded okay so if you see it's a blank blank s box right so nothing to worry so I'll be going to start working on the code so first thing first what we'll do uh we'll be just going to first uh load this haran variable so fromb load. right and then from Lang community. tools okay import heav search results okay then load. ENB done okay then tool equals to right such results right like this then I will write Max result results okay Max results I'll just going to put it one okay then I'll be just going to write search depth will be Advanced okay Advanced okay then what else um I think include answer include raw content and include images okay so include answer then equals to true then include raw content okay that is also going to be through okay and I just want to make include images okay and I don't think anything else is required once this is done so we just going to write response equals to Tool invoke okay and there I'll going to write a query right so it should be query so what I'll just write uh USA election 20 24 okay so this is a latest news uh let it run and then we just going to write print response okay so it will be a list of dictionary I think let's see it will come okay if you list in the list you have this Ur and the content so basically is coming from BC and this is the content what I do I can easily write list of zero and content okay hopefully this will work okay right now once I get this information okay I want to actually uh make this thing uh kind of uh summarize okay so this is the raw content okay raw content which is coming from here I want to summarize this thing right to summarize this thing what you need uh we need uh something to summarize like in the last tutorial we have seen how to uh summarize document right so let's see so first thing first from l. core. prompt right you can just write import set from template right so here I just going to write template equals to template equals to chat chat from template do from template okay and there we'll be just going to write this thing okay I easily right uh summarize this content uh with minimum sentences with uh with focusing on all important information okay so now uh this done now what will happen we'll be going to create a but for creating the first I need write from L open import that open then I just going to write llm equals to open like this and then model equals to GPT hen 4 okay everything is done here so now what we'll do we'll be going to create a this is done the result is done now is going to write chain and how how to create the chain right so to creating the chain I need to actually import another necessary like module so that is going to be from uh from Lang um that will be Lang chain. chains. combine document chains andore um M documents import create stop documents in right so it should be create stop document CH so it will be going to contain two things right llm and uh this prompt okay okay prompt is ready now what we will do uh summary to ch then right um dot invoke okay so context equals to Raw content now here I forget um summarize this content here what do just to context okay right and then we just going to print the summary and let's see what is coming let's see first it will uh get information from the internet uh what it is saying that object has no attribute page content this hold on uh something is strange here okay okay I'm just thinking uh why this is not working okay so basically uh it is failing let me check where actually it is getting failed H failing here because it's just a text document it is expecting a doc right what I'll do uh we'll be going to create uh another new thing here okay so let's see so from L because I need to uh I need to actually uh convert that into a document so form length chain do store okay do document equals to import document right so what I do I will be just going to write here SD summary document is this right and then SD do append okay okay what what we just going to happen there so it should be just hold on um it should be document right of page content page content will be this raw content okay raw content and it has two things if you go here in the Raw content what is the raw content it has URL and content so I can easily write Source equals to something as well okay so maybe I easily write here so metadata equals to something like this then Source okay equals to URL okay and here it will be URL okay so my summarized document is ready and here I can easily SD okay and now let's see what is happening okay the information whatever I'm getting from the web search I'm converting that into a lang document okay okay you see I'm getting the response here okay okay so here I want this is a print summary and I want to actually write the actual message so print raw content okay so I just want to some difference whether my prompt is correct not that okay so let's do it it will print the summary and then the raw content okay let's see okay okay I'm just checking everything is working fine or not y I think this reports are actually not updated so maybe that is why but yeah this is good that something is coming so maybe I want to do something uh uh something else uhle new flagship Apple new research let's see if I find something from the Internet or not and then we'll be just going to again create another document okay fine okay so raw content is there so I just don't need the raw content I just need the summary so once the summary is ready so we'll be going to use this thing for graph document right right so for that couple of things are required so from length dot I think graphs inut for graph and here I'll just going to create NE graph equals to NE graph right so one more thing we require that llm Transformer right to convert that thing using llm Transformer using uh NLP right so it will be part of length experimental graph Transformer okay from L experimental okay uh do graph like experimental do graph Transformer import llm Transformer right so here I'll just going to write lmore Transformer equals to what so this llm Transformer will be uh going to be created with the help of llm gr Transformer and in the llm I'll just going to use llm right done so the summary is ready with the summary I can create a graph document just create blank first and then what we'll do. append okay the same thing here just going to copy this entire thing okay because I just have only one url url will always same and I will be just going to ptain this part it should be summarized okay everything is ready right so if you want to print let's print the G first let's see okay ready what is happened like this let's see the GD so it will be a length document okay okay lengen lengthen _ community. drops okay okay done uh let's do it here and check okay so there is some problem sumary s equal to response Z URL okay okay what is saying list appex no keyword argument right so it should be I forget this should be document like this and like this I forgot okay let's see okay done so this is done now what we'll do we'll be just going to convert that into graph document so graphcore docs equals to llm Transformer right and inside that I'll be just going to GD right and then what we do I'll be just going to print this gra do okay uh let's clear this thing and let's execute okay h what it is saying LM Transformer object okay sorry it will be to gra document sorry guys it is my mistake I forgot to call the function okay now what we'll do um graph do add graph documents and inside that I'll be just going to write grab dos okay fine and now here I'm going to uh check still blank okay let's execute this thing okay okay let it execute okay this is ready let's go here and check basically if you see activity concept organization service study and so many different things are there so what I'll do I'll be just going to write uh call oke dot meta graph so we'll be able to see what is happening mhm okay that's it so this is just for a simple graph like okay but suppose uh you want to actually create uh graphs from uh multiple content okay multiple content means you want to uh uh want to actually continuously build a knowledge graph on the same topic from the internet search right so that time you can easily do it by uh doing this okay so this is just a p or you can call it as a prototype okay that uh web search result can be converted as a Knowledge Graph as well okay so uh I'm just going to give you guys the nearest use case whatever I can think uh suppose uh suppose your company is uh doing some sort of marketing U marketing campaign okay or maybe suppose um you are working for a trading uh high frequency Trading Company like Tower research Goldman Sachs or maybe Quai similar sort of company right so where uh they generally uh uh get some Mar Market influencing uh some some influencing or Mark uh some indicator which can influence the market like some news or some uh some cases illegal cases fraud cases some new product release press release Etc and based on that they can trigger an uh graph algorithm because you have the raw data from the web search after that you have this knowledge graph here right and once you have the knowledge gra you can apply graph algorithm to get some prediction so this is the very hypothetical thinking right so mainly nowadays uh most of the trading organization like um uh I mean trading organization means not like very small or midsize some Advanced companies like if you see you will find that AI driven tring strategies so how they like developing those strategies because to develop the strategy or automated strategy or AI driven strategy definitely need some data so that you can learn or train your machine learning model right or orse at least you can predict something so to get the data you have to do definitely some sort of research and after you get the research data you have to like parts that result into uh some sort of uh relational uh like relationship driven like manner like graph is why graph is popular because here every entity is combined with each other or connected with each other using some sort of like relation right and once you have the relationships are built then you can easily apply the vs algorithm right so I'm just giving you the example you can come across a different use case as well but this is the ultimate thing if you don't know how to actually integrate with the webar result and convert that into NE 4J graph you won't be able to actually grow right so that is why I'm just doing uh this sort of things and probably I'll do couple of more use cases and after that I'll be just going to start working on the fully fledged CFT rag okay so enough of talking guys that's it now what I'll do I'll be just going to conclude the video over here and before I conclude if you are watching my Channel or this video for the first
