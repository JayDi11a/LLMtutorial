[Music] [Music] what's up guys this is Ronnie welcome back to our Channel Total technology Zone this is tutorial one and this is going to be a brand new series or a playlist you can whatever you can say so basically in this playlist or in this series I'll be going to uh talk about and I'll teach you guys uh open cv5 for which is very important for computer vision deep learning okay and our programming language will be python so we can call it learning open cv5 with computer vision with python okay so this is going to be a really interesting series our main objective will be um computer vision or deep learning Focus on open CV 5 module and while doing uh various use cases with open uh with open CV 5 for deep learning and other things I'll be going to or maybe I will introduce some other uh libraries whatever is useful right so mainly we'll be going to deal with uh images different images video files Etc okay we'll try to integrate uh multiple uh like camera devices maybe your webcam maybe uh Street cam dash cam and we we'll try to uh like incorporate multiple uh interactive like projects okay so this is going to be a very interesting series and I'm excited to teach you guys and hopefully you guys are equally excited to learn okay so just stay tuned and as always my playlist or tutorials are going to be uh very much Hands-On driven I'll be going to do less Theory because theor is and other things you guys can get it from internet but mostly I'll try to break it uh I will try to break down the tutorials in multiple small use case driven approach and later on we'll try to build some project while using those small small use cases okay and uh this open CV 5 is very important because I think this is a latest module or latest release from open CB uh uh I think the last version was open cv4 this is open cv5 they introduced some C++ wrapping so if you're using python you will be able to see a lot of like speed enhancement and other things are there I'm not going to do in those details you can get it from the open CV 5 documentation okay so our first tutorial will be image read and write using open CV F this is the first objective like how to read and write using open CV okay and the prerequisite is uh this numai CPI and this one okay if you install this to modules this will be more than enough okay for reading the file we'll be going to use IM read function from the CB2 CB2 is actually the um import name of open CB okay okay and for I think we'll be going to use i r function from open CV okay and the source code will be available for this tutorial in this directory okay so without wasting much time let me start working on my main code if you see I have an image here like in the tutorial One Directory like this we'll be try to read this image okay so first thing first import CV2 okay right and then what we'll do uh we'll be going to create a variable input okay and in the input what we will do CV2 do I I read okay and inside that I'll be just going to write down the file path so just because it's a python uh sorry windows I have to use this R raw string or else it will not work okay and once this is done what I do I'll just going to write print input okay okay basically uh every image is represented as a nump array a multi-dimensional numpy array with three Channel and each channel will be going to be uh represented by uh 0 to to 225 okay zero means it's black and 225 sorry 255 means it is uh White okay so if you see here it's a multi-dimensional num array with three element right and each element is basically representing one pixel and 255 means white if you see here 90% of my image is actually white so that is why most of the cases we will see white and some cases it will be like this this part will be black because this but just because we have you cannot print everything here so that is why some parts are actually uh this out of scope okay and I said it is actually going to be a n array so what you do if you just type this thing so you'll be able to see it is actually a nump ARR okay yeah nump andd ARR okay and right so maybe I can try something else as well uh sh okay oh sorry is going to double let me yeah so see uh it is actually 225 by 3 means 225 rows are there and three columns are there like like this columns are there I mean this this and basically it has 225 elements right so this is the third dimension this the row okay this a threedimensional AR first of all you have to understand and every dimension of a three every element of a threedimensional array is actually a two dimensional array basically every element is actually this this like this we have total 225 elements are there okay that have to understand okay now we read the object okay now what we'll do now we'll be going to H create output out of this okay so what we'll do we'll just going to write output equals to CB2 dot I am right okay so I am right takes actually file name and image okay so let's write my file name okay so what can I write here let me write my fin actually new new dot let's say new.png okay and which file I'll be going to take the file will be input okay if I execute line you'll be able to see a new uh image here okay let's see you see a new image created here okay and let's execute also same right okay okay so now by default couple of things you have to understand by default uh CB2 reads reads the image as a BGR format BGR format means blue green red it is not RGB it is the exactly reverse orientation of RGB so BGR you have to remember and if you want to actually read the image in Gray scale or other you have to uh use something called CB2 do uh image color type or something like that those things will be discuss in the next tutorials how to read the image in a specific format or order but this is going to be a very interesting one um how to read the image and how to write the image and now couple of things I'll introduce here first of all let's say read image as a PNG format now you want to save it as jpg you have to just write jpg you see the image is actually getting converted into jpg see here right this is going to be very interesting image conversion we just now learned from this small piece of code and also we just learn how to read an image how to get the image uh information and after that um we'll be going to see the image can be represented as an NP array we saw the image like bytes and we saw the uh image like representation between 0 to 255 0 means black and 255 means it's actually white and after that we saw how to uh write back the image into a file new file and also uh we have seen how to convert the image from PNG to jpeg right so very exciting uh times are exciting times are coming so hopefully you guys are uh going to practice this thing please try to practice and try to include some more use cases for example we just read uh images uh one single images I want you to actually create multiple read multiple images and try to play around with this thing and if you are already started working on uh computer vision or maybe if you're working with some computer vision project maybe for your client or for maybe many of you are already started working as a um what I say like uh College project right or university project so if you have some problem just let me know I'll try to incorporate all those things in the upcoming uh tutorial or else we can uh you can communicate with me via telegram Channel or maybe you can reach out to me email okay so that's it enough of talking but before I conclude the tutorial I would like to say a couple of things guys please try to subscribe to my channel if you're watching this video for the first time if you are already uh my uh watched my previous videos but haven't subscribe Please Subscribe because it's a request and this is a personal request until and unless you guys don't subscribe my channel will not grow and I love to grow guys because the moment you guys are start uh subscribing to my channel uh my audience base will increase and I'll try to actually I'll be able to reach large number of audience and I'll get some push from YouTube algorithm as well okay and to help me with the algorithm try to share my videos try to um like the videos try to hit the Bell notification icon and also if you enjoy the videos try to put some comments so it will increase the engagement uh ratio on my videos right okay so please help me guys grow I need your help to grow so that's it okay so I'll be just going to conclude the video over here we'll see you in the next video till then take care goodbye have a nice day and happy learning [Music]
