what's up guys this is Ronnie welcome back to our Channel tot technology Zone and today's topic will be how to talk with CSP files using Lang chain agents and open AI so let me explain the tutorial um within a few minute so basically um suppose you have one CSP file or your personal CSV file or maybe a CSV file which is local to you not available um or not a uh not a CSP file on online okay why I'm saying this thing online or offline I'll explain this thing maybe in the later uh tutorials but try to understand uh the concept of this tutorial first supp suppose you have one CSP file which you already stored or save on your computer now you want to actually get some facts out of the CSP file or maybe you want to actually know some information from the CSP file or basically you want to do some data analytics TS but you don't want to write the python code by your own so that uh you will just ask some question and it will give you some answer and based on that you can create your report just like a boom okay so that is the fundamental objective of this tutorial so now um why Lang chain agents and why llm uh sorry why open llm cuz uh open llm means under the hood it's kind of a chat GPT uh back end right so basically with the help of chat GPT you cannot actually uh use um a CSP file to talk with the CSV F yeah definitely there are multiple plugins are available you can do it you have to browse it then you have to upload the file and after that you can do it but that's a different part here we are going to use the pure penila python code to talk with our own CSC files with the help of L chain agents and open llm there's a new term you guys are hearing now so that is Agent so basically it's a it's a lang chain uh component it's a component of Lang chain or basically it's a class which will help you to take some action uh based on some sequence right and what will be the sequence it will be decided by the llm or maybe the input from the pre or maybe the output from the previous sequence or maybe the input okay so suppose you have a CSV file and you have langen agent and you have open llm so langen agent will use the open llm to do the sequencing or to the to sorry to do the or to develop the sequence based on the reasoning right so suppose you ask some question now Lang chain adapter will read the question and then it will use the openi llm and after that it will do some analysis based on the CSP file and then it will generate some sequence sequence one sequence two sequence 3 sequence four whatever and every sequence it is going to take some action the sequence and the actions are going to be the responsibility of the L chain agent so lanch agent is actually going to uh take some actions based on the sequence based on the input you provided and the llm llm is basically used to do the reasoning means it will help you to generate the right sequence and generate the right action and generate the right answer okay so enough of theory so here a little bit uh from the lch and documentation so the core idea of agent is to use llm to choose the sequence of action to take so basically what I said so basically a Lin agent is actually going to uh use llm to take some action okay based on some sequence okay in chain sequence are hardcoded in agent language model is used to desing the used as an aging engine to determine which actions to take and which order so basically llm is actually going to use to develop the sequence and develop the action or perform the action okay right so enough of talking now I'll be going to do the coding so talk with CSP file using CSP agent and open a so there are multiple uh agents are available in Lang chain adapter CSP agent maybe normal file agent Excel file agent so we'll be going to see all of them in upcoming or future videos but right now I'm just focusing on CSV file in this tutorial cuz I got so many requests I thought of creating this tutorial but I just want to highlight one thing maybe in next four five or six videos I'll be going to talk thly on the Lan agents only so maybe uh I can refer this in a different way maybe I'll be going to use different comp components or different agent actually different agent use case to do something uh with the Lang so maybe I'll use some agent to do something on the S3 bucket file or maybe something from the Google or maybe whatever what else I'll see but everything will be handson and practical okay so let's open my vs code and this is my uh CSV file so basically maybe let me see how many rows are there so it has total 11,000 rows are there and basically it's a book data and if I go here if you see here so it's a book ID title author average rating ISBN ISBN 13 language code okay then number of pages so many things are there right so ratings is there okay so basically if I just go here so what is there just hold on Yeah so basically publication date publisher reviews count reviews rating everything is there so I'll be going to use this CSP file to do the question answering okay so let's start writing our code so first thing we need to actually import the llm so it will be from langen do llms import so open open AI right so maybe let's see okay it's working so I don't need to install anything sometime I keep on changing my laptop so it happens I don't know what happened here open if I don't know yes okay now let's go to the next line so it should be from Lang chain do agents do agent types import agent type and last thing will be from lenin. Agents import create CSP agent okay so and just to uh uh show you my data frame from the so basically this create CSP agent is going to create a pandas data frame and based on that pandas data frame it will do some sort of reasoning based on the uh question okay so I want to just show you guys that how this file looks in a data frame vanilla data frame format okay but uh it is not mandatory right so just to show you guys I just import pandas as PD sorry so basically this is going to be PD do read CSV and I'll be going to just write books. CSV right and I'll just going to write print and it will be DF dot head okay so hopefully so see it looks like this book ID title publication date publisher and so many things are there right so now I'll just going to create an agent so agent is going to be create CSP agent so first it will take llm the first keyword argument and agent will be open Ai and maybe temperature is zero and then path path will be the CSP file path so we go here I'll just right click copy path and just paste it okay and then I'll be just going to uh select my agent type so maybe agent uncore type equals to agent type dot so I will Zero s react description okay and then I'll just print the agent let's see what is coming what it is coming from here what is what is actually giving me so basically yes so basically this path is kind of this thing so basically maybe I can just use this thing so raw string okay so see uh my agent type is actually agent is actually going to give me something here see something here so this llm agent prompt input so so many things are there right so it started from here right uhhuh okay so I I did a spelling mistake so because of that it is actually giving me this error so just copy this thing uh temp uh uh temp first transfer model please confirm the temperature is what you intended warning temperature is not a default parameter temp ra pleas please confirm please okay so basically okay so hopefully this will work now yes yes so not is working okay sometimes small spelling mistakes are going to give you some error now what is actually going to happen I'll be going to ask some question to it right so basically I will write something so maybe print agent run and I'll ask some question okay so how many okay so let me check what are the things so title authors how many uh authors authors are mentioned in the file okay so it is going to give me how many distinct okay so let's some warnings are coming just ignore so total 6,639 distinct authors are mentioned in the file now you can ask me you are talking about some sequence right so I want to see the sequence so for that what is actually going to happen you have to mention something called veros Equals to true so maybe I can just write it here okay so now what will happen it will generate the sequence as well okay okay so let's see you will get the sequence now yes so let me make it a little bit see I need to to find out how many unique authors are in the data frame so DF authors so this is actually writing this thing okay okay so now let me actually do something else how many distin authors are mentioned in the file okay uh maybe I can just write which author uh find the author who has most number of books find the author who has the most number of books Let's see okay Stephen King has the most books in this right so and all these things are actually mentioned here if you want to see the thing see de books value.com it is going to give you right right now uh or maybe now I will write it is in a different way uh question find the author who has most number of books written in non English language or a little bit tricky okay okay clear and let's do see I know the final answer final answer is actually this but how actually it is I need to find the author who has most books written in all English language right so DF language code is this authors and value counts head one right I got this thing now what we'll do uh find the author who has the most number of book written in English language okay okay see if it is a mixture then different answer if it is a English different answer I mean it is a uh non- English and a different answer okay so now find the author who has most number of books written in uh year who has most number of books published in year 2015 let's see whether I'm getting something or not it's a very tricky question now see okay I need to filter the data only includes a book publishing this thing so first it is filtering this thing and it got a data frame right then it is actually uh doing something else okay see now I need to find the author who move this public in this thing then actually it is again and doing this thing right so it got the answer so basically this is really interesting thing actually right so and why I am selecting this agent type because it is actually uh uh using some reasoning for taking action and that is why I'm just taking this thing okay and if you want to actually know more about this thing just uh go to the Lang chain documentation and search for Lang chain agent types in the Google or maybe if you just write Lang Chen different agent types uh then it will give you the complete answer right so I believe you guys enjoys enjoying this uh tutorial now and uh you thoroughly enjoyed the concept how to actually use the uh CSV file for uh talking or chatting or rather than getting some inside out out of it or maybe suppose you want to develop an utility I'm just giving you an very very very heavyweight example suppose uh you you are working for a uh data data analytics or data engineering form right so there uh your company uh like Executives like executive category means suppose your board of director or managing director or maybe very senior level uh like a person who is Who belongs to a very senior level right so he wants to actually get uh some insight from the data you are definitely not going to um teach him the coding right and at the same point of time you are not going to uh do the coding for him or her on a on demand basis suppose today they are going to give you a file X tomorrow they are going to give you a file y so every time you have to do coding right now if you think if you want to actually develop this utility I already developed this utility in five lines of code right now you have your job is actually you have to create an API right from this thing and you have to create a back end and you have to create a front end so then what will happen this this path will be going to come from a uh from the front end and it will hit this back end right and the executive will actually going to get the answer means there will be a front end where execu is actually going to upload the file and the back end is written with this same same code and it will uh generate the answer so the executive or whoever is your client is going to get the answer without knowing the code or without knowing the context behind the developer right so this is the kind of uh utility right now every company is actually looking for and people are thinking that it's a very uh like huge or very complex thing to develop but now I give you a gist out of it so now you guys can uh develop your like concept intuition through it and try to develop some use case and what are the things just now I explained my plan is to actually create an uh API first with the help of that and after that we'll try to create a full-fledged application so so creating an API I'll be going to or I'll try to do it in the next tutorial but creating an a full-fledged application will require some sort of backend knowledge and some sort of like frontend knowledge backend knowledge you can use it using using this thing with a python fast API and for front end we can use any JavaScript framework so that will be done maybe in the future when I will start the project work but I'm just going to give you an example that how this things can be integrated with some real world industry like specific use case Okay so that's it guys now I'll be going to conclude the tutorial but before I conclude the tutorial I would like to uh request you guys uh on three three things right first thing uh please try to subscribe to our Channel hit the like button and also hit the Bell notification so you should not miss any notification uh regarding our future videos um right second thing guys please uh try to put some honest feedback on the comment box good or bad doesn't matter it has to be honest if you think something is missing in the video or something can be done in a better way or something you don't like in the video please try to inform us so that we can actually improve our quality and come back with a uh better quality in the next time and if you think something is helpful or something is helping on this video just try to uh inform us with that appreciation because this sort of uh appreciations are going to uh motivate us and also if you put some comment it will actually help us to um like U align with the Google algorithm and Google algorithm will help you to actually help us to actually re a larger audience and that will ultimately boost our motivation as well and last but not least uh try to share our videos with your family and friend whoever you think will get some benefit out of it okay that is also indirectly help us to reach the larger audience space right and most important thing it's a recommendation don't just try to watch our videos watch our videos two times three times and after that whatever just now I did try to do the same thing by your own means try to write the coding by your own and try to do something different friend okay so that will help you to actually uh gain some confidence and you will push yourself to the next level and ultimately the more code you write or more coding you will do it will help you to uh reach the expertise level sooner okay so that's it guys we'll see you in the next video till then take care goodbye and have a nice day n
