[Music] [Music] what's up guys this is Ronnie welcome back to our Channel Total technology Zone this is tutorial 26 and today's topic will be how to chat with Wikipedia page using Lama index okay so in this tutorial we will learn how to integrate with Wikipedia when I say integrate uh it means uh with this technique or with this method you can read uh any Wikipedia page within a few lines of code we can you can pass the text you can do some filtering you can uh you can create a report or you can do anything right so that is why I'm saying integration but BAS basically uh here we are going to use a specific module which is created by Laha and with the help of that we'll be going to read uh any specific uh Wikipedia pages and from there we'll be going to do our uh uh things like for example we can create um indexes like within a vector uh IND database like you can create a vector index and after that we can do simple question answering okay this is going to be very simple tutorial but again uh if you're going to work on uh multi capability driven AI agents then this sort of Integrations are very much required with Lama index okay so without wasting much time let me move ahead with the tutorial so these are the prerequisite so this Lama index um uh readers uh this one is required and this is also required okay as usual the source code will be available in this GitHub link okay so I Will Not Waste much time let me start writing the code here directly so first thing first what we do we'll be going to import from Lama uh llama index llama index. code here we'll be going to import like vector store index okay and another thing we'll be going to write Lama index dot readers. Wikipedia then we'll be going to import uh okay sorry guys some uh some some uh like something is happening uh something is happening outside so I'll be just going to uh give a pause over here and shortly I will start the recording again okay noises are coming actually okay guys so the noise has been stopped so let's start again so I imported this uh module and then I'll be going to import let's say Wikipedia reader now what we'll do uh I will create a reader uh reader here uh reader object and this will come like this okay and then we'll be going to load it okay so let's say uh let's do something loader equals to reader dot leader. load data and probably here it it will be pages and it will be a string uh uh it will be a list uh string um like string within um within a list actually okay um so there you have to write down the page name so if you see here I have the page name brat Ki so it is one of the famous Cricket player okay if you don't like Cricket then I'm sorry it's done then uh then what will happen so basically here what I'm doing here I'm actually uh loading the data right and after that we need to convert that into documents right so this will load the data and after that it will create the documents right so uh so maybe I can do this is ultimately creating the document and after that we'll just write print document just to check whether everything is coming ni or not okay so let's see so this will write the page content here okay everything is written so fine so what I'll do I'll just clear it here and now I will create an instance of vector database so vs equals to Vector store Index right then from documents okay which document so documents will be documents right done now we'll create a query engine okay so query uncore engine and this is going to be vs. squer engine right completed now we'll create an chat now response and response will be what response will be query engine do query right inside the query I'll be just going to write my question I'll be going to write couple of question uh what is the birth date of Barat okay right then print response right now what we do now we going to do this thing okay let's see [Music] okay so bat Koh was born on 5th November this uh let's take some typical question okay [Music] so okay okay uh when did Co debut okay let's [Music] see let's see is able to answer it or not I don't know whether it is going to do it or not K made for the Indian cricket team in test and ODI Cricket when did go debut uh when what what the date and here when GOI did H debut in od test okay let's see a little bit complicated question okay let's see I'm not using any model maybe it is using the default model of llama index maybe it is uh U let's see Ki made his debut OD Cricket in uh OD Cricket on August 18 2008 and in test Cricket uh June 20 2011 right so I believe uh everything is fine over here right so let's uh ask another question uh how many centuries he scored in ODI let's ask this question he scored 50 centuries in one day international okay is everything is fine okay so that is what I would like to represent in this tutorial and I think we are very much uh okay not very much we are absolutely on point okay so now um why this sort of tutorials are important let me give you some example suppose uh suppose you are working for a customer and customer wants to to develop an AI agent which is going to give some answer to some some question but those questions are uh uh related to some Global product or Global topic and there your company wants to develop a certain capabilities where you need to search in the internet you need to search uh in the Wikipedia you need to search Reddit you need to search stack Overflow medium YouTube so many different platforms so that is why is this that is why this small small integration for every platform is very much essential because if you don't know how to integrate uh like this sort of platform then probably you won't be able to consider for those sort of jobs or maybe in the interview because see everything is now just available in the internet right but the company or the interviewer wants to see uh whether you know this thing or whether you develop something in the past based on that they're going to hire you right so that they should not waste any time on uh training or other stuff right so that is why um whenever you are getting some time from your regular job try to learn something and same thing is for me whenever I'm getting some time from the job I'm learning and I'm Al also creating this videos for you and trust me guys I'm actually having uh multiple uh like streams of like income ultimately uh uh everything will be judged in terms of right uh how much money you are making from a job right and this sort of jobs are giving a very stady and well um like kind of handsome or some some some like uh yeah some quite a good amount of money right whether it's a freelance job whether it's a freelance project part-time project whether you are doing it from the any freelancing website or app work or Etc right so that is why learn it then showcase it by building your GitHub and Linkedin profile you will uh start getting calls from everywhere right okay so enough of talking guys so before I close so I would like to uh raise couple of point point is not it's not a point it's a request
