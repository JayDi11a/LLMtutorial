what's up guys this is Ronnie welcome back to our Channel Total technology Zone this is tutorial 59 and today I'll be going to do something new and again I got this request uh from couple of days ago and it was from one of my students and after that actually I researched this topic and I found that it is a very simple thing but um like very less I I mean um I mean I mean not even less like there is no such tutorial available but the tutorial is very simple like we know how to actually do Google search using langin and here I'll be just going to refine that version like how to image search using or how to photo search using langen and after that how to download those images right so basically you can call it download images with Google search using langen and open AI so with the help of Lang chain and open a you'll be able to download any specific image based on your like um based on your given query okay so that is the objective of this tutorial so it means we'll be going to ask something to our llm and llm will actually going to use langen uh tool that is a Google search API tool or Sur API tool and and and after that it will just search those images and after that you'll be able to uh get the response and from the response we'll download the images okay obviously from the Lang chain agent we won't get the downloaded images so basically Lang chain will give the URL version okay and from there actually we'll be able to uh download the images okay so we'll do some extra coding so I'll show you everything okay so this is the thing like first we'll use the Lang chain utilities to search using Google images and then we'll generate the image URL from the search and after that you will download images from the Reston Ur okay that's it in this uh like link you will get the source code okay so let me minimize everything here right and after that we start writing the code okay okay okay so so this is going to be very basic tutorial I'm not going to um do anything extra here okay so let's see from L chain do utilities okay import uh what exactly going to import so basically this putties import Sur Ser then API then wer W right that's it with and request that's it right then okay so first thing first what we'll be going to do we'll be going to actually add the surface key so I just copy this line because I just want don't want to actually waste some additional time so basically will search uh you will get this key from your Ser API okay so you have to just search with Ser API in the Google it will redirect you to the website in the website you have to just sign up and you will get your key okay so that's it our environment varable is set now what we'll do we'll be going to create some parameters right so we'll write b r params and it will be going to this is going to be a dictionary okay so what we'll do we'll just write engine okay engine so I will use uh engine as Google images okay so Google images okay so this is going to be our engine okay so what language we'll be going to use uh ge location you don't uh required and I think this engine is more than enough okay okay so right okay so now what will happen Let's uh create an instance of our search with a variable so search equals to search API rapper and inside that we'll be going to pass the pars PA a params equals to perms equals to parms right and then just going to create something called results okay equals to search do run and we'll ask something from string okay and after that we'll just Brint this result okay so let's see what is exactly going to come okay so maybe I can just write Gateway of India Gateway of India okay let's see let's see so this is saying there is no module called Lang chain okay what is this I don't know what is the eror so I'm using different version of python maybe because of that okay so you see here I got so many URLs here right okay so but this is coming as a list format but this is not a list this is a string so what you have to do you have to just click on type and check whether what is the format of this thing because I got the result and from the result we have to actually download this images okay print and if I do it you'll see this is going to be stream right okay so now what we'll do we'll be going to convert that into a list okay so let's keep it like this okay right sorry guys I just got the call so so now what you have to do you have to actually download those images right so for that first you have to convert that in this string the string into like list okay so how to do it so this is going to be very easy so what we'll do we'll be just going to first replace this and then this and then this quotes Okay so four replace three replacement will be there so data will be results do replace okay so it should be this this okay then like this it should be data okay and again there is another data I'm using the same variable again and again so this is going to be again replace this first this this and at the end we'll be going to create the main variable that is going to be URLs is going to be data do split and it will be based on the comma right so I got the URL so let's print this thing okay so if I print this thing this is going to give me all the URLs so if you see here yeah so now okay so so results. replace data equals to data DOL data data split okay and data so basically I don't understand like this with nothing this with nothing okay so the main concern is actually this extra thing is actually coming and here also this extra thing is coming I don't know from here actually this things are coming okay okay so results equals to data do let me check what is this here this why this is like not show this let me check ideally this should be replaced right yes so this is replac oh okay I did a mistake I actually put two two equals to that is why the problem Oh strange okay okay okay still the same problem is coming datal to this things it should be again I did a mistake again okay yeah okay this okay it should not be comma I did a mistake it should be single quotes right and then comma okay all done fine I got the list now you see here this is a list now you have to just download this thing okay so how to download this thing so simply for URL in URLs right simple thing the request library is already there and then what is actually going to do uh response response equals to request. get and the URL right Ur and what is actually going to happen if response status code is 200 if response status code equals to 200 this is going to be equals to equals to 200 right so 200 then only we'll be able to download if there is no uh like uh nothing like uh the request is not fulfilled so it is not going to be work okay so what is actually going to do we'll be going to get a file name so file name is actually going to come from the URL so URL do spit okay and it's going to use like this and the last one will be our name because this is our entire URL like this and I just want the last part okay this name okay like this okay so everything is done right and now what is actually going to happen uh with open okay file name WB f f okay and file dot right equals to response. content so this response do content so basically I'm just writing opening this file with this name and after that I'm just writing inside that file okay and what is actually going to write print okay so if string like this and image downloaded f f u l l y like this and we'll be just going to write down the file name then if else we just write something fail to receive image filed download okay okay okay so let's do so all file will be downloaded here okay so let's see okay so see one by one every file is getting downloaded one 2 3 4 okay all every all downloaders are completed let's see whether all images are actually belongs to uh like uh Gateway of India or not so so basically okay so this is all our different file so first file so this is Gateway of India this is this is Gateway of not Gateway of India right okay okay okay okay okay this is G India so it is giving some irrelevant photos as well okay this is G of India this is okay okay so something cool let's try something else as well so let's wait just hold on where is this uh what I what should I I okay Mr 2014 in classic division so it should be Chris boomed so let's see whether we are going to get the Chris Bumstead photo or not photos are getting downloaded so let's see too many photos are downloaded so let's see I think that will be from the top yeah thir says first so why they are saying okay I said 2024 okay so 2024 is no more there I mean not happened yet yeah so so maybe 2023 Mr Olympia 2003 in classic division so let's see okay okay yeah okay so this is not a very refined tutorial I don't know what exactly you guys going to do this tutorial but I have I have something in my mind so basically suppose you are going to develop some sort of uh reporting or some sort of analysis or maybe you are going to work on some sort of uh news generation based on some text and images so basically suppose your job is to actually uh create an anchor driven uh like news so first thing you have to actually capture the images uh and news from various article and after that we'll be going to summarize the entire thing and after that we'll be going to create a video from the text and from the images right with the help of AI so that time this Google search images are actually going to be very useful Okay so this is just the vanilla version of uh this feature but until and unless you are not using it um uh to create some sort of like Enterprise application or some real world use case which can solve some business problem or some some some some meaningful like uh um some meaningful use cases so till the time uh like it has no use so that is why like if you have something on your mind you can try it out or else you can send me and uh like uh what you said what do you say you can send me some uh comments on the comment description or the comment box so that I can create some more videos out of it okay so that's it for today and before I conclude the video I just like to request something like guys uh this is uh this is 59 tutorial I have uploaded today so you can imagine that how much effort and like um uh time we are investing uh to create this content so basically me and my C are actually working so just a token of appreciation I'm expecting for all of you guys guys please if possible try to subscribe to our Channel hit the like button put some
