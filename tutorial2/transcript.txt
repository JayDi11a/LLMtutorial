[Music] [Music] what's up guys this is Ronnie welcome back to our Channel Total technology Zone this is tutorial 117 and today's topic will be how to summarize multiple do mment using Lang chain I believe uh in the past um I have shown you guys how to summarize a single document and um while doing that I I never actually came across uh to the situation that I have to create this video again but uh but um but never mind uh basically last week I received one request and there one of my um channel members um he was actually asking that I have multiple documents and how to how to do uh how to how to create a summary out of it okay then I thought of um uh giving him uh like using for Loop and all but uh the request is very interesting he's saying that um we need to summarize uh all the document at the same point of time and we need to uh get the summary based on the three documents so then actually um I started doing some research and I came across to this thing so this is going to be a very important tutorial though from the name it's it looks it is very simple but it is very very important tutorial based of based on um this thing uh like nowadays the AI news agencies AI news channels are actually creating news report for example um they they have develop some sort of news aggregator those aggregators are uh getting the news from multiple sources maybe uh same event um same event for same event they're getting news from multiple sources and when they going to generate the AI driven content or the content generated by AI what they will do they will take all the cont all all the all the sources I mean all like um information from all the sources and after that they will do a summarization and then they will uh create the AI generated content so this is just an example but the application could be um could be on a higher magnitude right so let's not discuss all those things let's come back to the tutorial and hopefully you hopefully you guys will enjoy this thing okay so let me open my vs code okay let's start the tutorial so first of all I have three news articles there exactly I'm trying to mimic that and then um we have to generate a summary from this thing okay so first thing first import iio to read this file and then we'll do from L chain okay underscore code okay do documents okay then import document right okay now let's see okay so there we'll be going to pass but before that let's try to do something okay so for let's do this thing okay so I'm just thinking how to do it um let's um let's Okay import o okay and then and then glove okay so first CWD equals to os. CWD okay so this is going to give me my current working directory then I'll be just going to find for all the text text file okay for that so it will be glob but glob top okay then then it will be CWD then plus then something like this then txt but it would be a start start. txt right and then let's try to print so this should give me a list of all my files okay let's do it okay so what it saying uh okay so I think slash and then okay I think it will be something like this let's see uh okay it I did a mistake actually all three files are coming cool now what we'll do we'll be going to read this file one by one right so for file in files okay with iio do open okay and then it will be file then it will be read mode and then uh then encoding encoding equals to UT 58 right sorry as F1 right then data equals to f1. read right and once this is done then what will happen um um thinking uh how to actually do it so let's read this thing one by one okay so then maybe f1. close Okay and then what will happen we'll be go sorry and then bring data right so let's do this thing hopefully all three news articles are all three news article came actually okay okay so now what we'll do we'll be going to uh create let's say uh multiple uh documents okay so I'm just thinking how to do it just give me a moment so basically it will be a list and within the list multiple document will be there so first of all so let's create a list called document right and there I'll be going to write page content page content will be data right and there should be something called metad meta data right my metad data will be [Music] title title and what could be the title of this thing okay so maybe uh I just going to get this name of this thing so maybe uh file dot so this is my file name this is my file name if I split file with single slash so file. spit okay so file something like this and then minus one the last one okay okay it is coming then what will happen so okay I did a mistake actually so it should be actually it's a blank list okay and then what will happen documents app equals to uh what I going to do I'm just thinking this one right cut okay okay I think this is clear to everyone what I'm doing now and after that what I'll do I just going to the document okay so let's see what is going to happen hopefully everything is fine yeah if you see here um so this is news. txt then title this thing there should be another title yeah everything is kind my document is now generated now what will happen now next part now the Lang part the most fun part is We Begin now right so let's see what I can do here should be from Lang chain okay L chain. chains right uh LS do M documents right uh then import this is the important thing create document right okay and this should be one from template so from L right Len doore core underscore core okay lore core. comps I think okay prompts and what we have import that prom template right everything is ready here now what you'll have uh what you'll do we just going to create a variable called prompt okay what will be there in the prompt prom template uh prom template right from template and inside there I will just write summarize uh the summarize content and here and there I'll be just going to write content okay so this is my variable right and now what will happen we going to set up here with help of this variable so create document right then we'll just write llm right and then we'll going to write prompt okay this prompt is ready now the most important part I didn't create any umm object so from Lang import CH open a and then LM okay LM equals to Chad open and inside that I'll just going to write model equals to gp4 fine everything is fine and then what we'll do we'll just going to write response so do invoke right so. invoke is fine so with the chain. invoke we can actually uh let me check uh with the chain invoke what will will be going to do it should be content okay and this content will be what this content will be documents if you remember this documents okay okay and then response okay okay I believe everything is fine so only thing what I do I'm just going to comment out this line because it is going to create unnecessary like me it will be messy here right so let's see uh I'll be just going to run it here okay okay okay so let's start okay okay PR must accept the contest as an input variable uh just hold on I hold [Music] on content and just hold on why this is saying like this I said uh uh I have written where it is content okay so this content is here and and here. invoke I have written invoke is here so must accept context input variable receive PR input variable prompt accept Okay I understood now okay c o txt context and here okay context maybe okay okay so basically we have to declare the variable with context okay if you see now now I got the summarization has unfailed ground breing promises like thish scientist renewable energy and there is something like this all this three things I think something uh traffic delay this one second one is renewable energy and this thing all these three things are actually coming so uh summarize [Music] mmu okay content with with with little uh bullet okay I don't know whether they will understand the context or not but let's see okay [Music] yeah see this is nice right yeah I'm Amazed by the I'm actually am by theability of this module within Lang chain this is superb like you can achieve so many different things suppose you are a college student or maybe you are uh you are a school uh student and if you want to do some uh Project work and there probably you need to do a lot of formatting so you just give the URL langing will scrape that URL get the content format this thing whatever is your requirement okay so I am super excited so that's it I believe uh the guy who actually ask for this tutorial I think his name is uh Kumar so Kumar so this is for you you ask me to give a shout out to you so I'm just giving shout out to you so hopefully we'll uh like it and see similarly if you guys are having any any problem any Project work or if you want me to help please let me know I'll try to do it okay okay so let's conclude the video over here but before I conclude i' would like to ask couple of uh requests this this things are my personal requests if you are enjoying this video and haven't subscribed
