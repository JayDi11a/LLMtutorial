what's up guys this is Ronnie welcome back to our Channel Total technology Zone this is tutorial 115 and today's topic will be how to generate long length video using Luma AI or you can call it as a how to develop an video generator app which is capable of generating long length video means the video length must be greater than 5 Second by default or in in in Luma AI you can only create 5sec video not more than 5c video so in this tutorial I will show you the tricks uh by applying that you can create long length video even you can create maybe let's say a movie as well like or or you can create Instagram reals and a lot of content creators are actually creating Instagram reels or viral reels using this uh Luma AI okay and in this tutorial I'll show you how to create at least 10 second 15 second 30 second reals using Luma AI okay so let's stay tuned with the tutorial so ultimate objective is generate long length video and uh the source code is actually available here okay so without wasting much time let's jump into the coding part okay so let's start working on the first thing first thing is actually we'll be going to uh import a lot of uh module like import or let's say from uh Luma AI import Luma AI right we'll be going to initiating a client using Luma Ai and then we'll set up from L chain opening I import uh Chad open a and next thing from length chain do prompts import prompt template and let create an lmal to open Ai and there I'll just write model equals gp40 right and there I'll just write template equals to uh you are and intelligent and creative uh agent who can write we can write we can ex Express uh uh an Express IMA imaginary thoughts in in a single line with minimum words uh thought about let's say input okay done now let's create the template prompt okay so the prompt will be uh prompt will be actually from template do prore template and there I'll be just going to write template okay all done it's fine everything is fine okay then what will happen we'll just create a chain here CH equals to prompt and llm and then we just going to write response or let's this is going to give me the video prompt or maybe response equals to CH invoke okay and this is going to be input and this input will come from a variable called input okay how to actually get that input as a variable so that is the main thing now we'll be going to set up an stream l y so import stream L okay as St and then input equals to St do text area and there I'll be just going to write enter your subject okay and I'm just going to write do title and there I just write video in a trator app okay then everything is fine so this input okay so now what we'll do we'll just going to write if okay so now on top of we'll be just going to do one more thing uh I just write durations like what will be the durations of the video I just want so maybe I can just write duration could be 5 Second 10 second 15 second and 20 second okay uh make sure you have you have cr it all else it will not work okay then select T underscore duration will be what selected duration will be uh like St do select box I think select box for text box I don't remember uh I don't know what will be that so just hold on I believe it is going to be uh St do select box and there you're going to write uh your option anything you can write anything and in comma you can just write duration duration done so now what will happen if uh input is not none if input is not none then what will happen then it will initiate a but button equals to do button okay and the button Ty sub button right done and like this and then my video prompt will be video underscore prompt will be this prompt will be used for video v m video prompt will be response response. invoke okay now what we'll do we'll be just going to display that the stre L WR okay and there is going to write this video PR as done now with help of this video prompt we'll be going to generate the video depending on that so now we'll be going to initiate a for Lo for I in range okay will be what so second is divided by five right so we are going to actually uh look look through the video and we'll be just going to extend the video means first we create a 5sec video then we'll be going to create the video and add that but the end of the video should be the start of the next video so for that the is very much important here be what we'll be going to do selected duration by five so basically this will if it is a 10c video then this Loop will run through two times means 10c video will be created right and here what we'll do we'll be just going to create something called IDs so why I'm doing this thing let you know right this is done now what will happen this is actually going to run through it okay okay so now we'll be going to create this two function okay so this is going to be very easy right so what will do we just going to copy this thing nothing else will be required function will be there one is actually simple generation and one is actually extend generation so first thing then generate video then video okay this will only require an input input prompt and what will be this so response equals to response equals to client so the client is actually this is the client let's copy this thing here okay this client equals to client okay do Generations right create means we're giving the create now here going to use the prompt prompt equals to input okay and what will happen we'll be just going to uh we'll be just going to return uh this thing okay so let's say uh what you want to do uh this video will be created but until and unless uh this this input ID is actually not ready we don't want to actually WR this thing means this will be going to create something but uh it is not ready ready so what is required once this Fe is ready that time you have to actually use it for that once this Fe is ready that only you have to return it okay for that purpose what we have to do we have to actually write ID right this ID so ID is actually response ID right now metadata we have to get the metadata right met of video how to get the metadata of video basically Cent okay do Generations get is ID equals to ID now what we'll do we'll be just going to write while one means uh I just want to do it inside this just hold on but so this is r generat mean the prompt is generated now going to do it metadata now what we'll do if metad dat dot State equals to equals to completed then what we'll do we just going to return return the id id of this video else what we'll do we'll be just going to wait for 10 second again else uh so this is this is the catch right import time okay and here we'll be just going to write if time dot slip let's wait for 15 second okay means let's say p is generated is in the dreaming state it will come here it will say go it is not completed so what we will do it will go here okay so like that way it will be keep on doing and the moment it is completed it will get the return return right so what it do here so range so basically so response equals to okay so maybe I can just write uh first ID first uh so maybe I can simply write okay basically this we have to actually two thing so for first ID it will be like this and remaining thing it will be in a different way so basically if I I equals to equals to Z then what will happen um we can simply write if I Z then first first ID equals to uh okay so remember we have to import this thing from from generate video uh import import generate import okay I don't know what is happening here okay it will be generate video now what will happen here I'll be just going to write generate video generate video will be going to work on this PR actually this video prompt right so the first ID is generated right once the first ID is generated we be going to use that first ID to generate the next ID right but what will happen I have to actually app this thing here okay so I just do app okay here just going to write first ID right this is done if I equals to Z it is going to happen else what will happen for else function we'll be going to actually write nextcore ID and for that we'll be just going to write another function okay so what is that uh extend uh video we going to extend the video and this is going to work on two things like input pump and ID because the ID is very much important without ID the extension will actually not going to work okay so what will happen here first of all again you have to write response okay response equals to client Okay C do Generations do create okay like this like this and this and here will be going to write prompt so prompt will be always input right and then what will happen we'll be going to write something called key frames key frames frames we have to give a dictionary this we have to mention the frame m zero right FR Zer is going to be another dictionary right right so the type will be type will be generation right all these things I came to know from the documentation I don't remember anything okay guys so if you think that I remember so many it's a misconception no need to remember anything just use your just use your intelligence and read the documentation that's it and this idea will come from ID that's it everything is done now the same thing now the exactly same thing you have to do here right okay ID isal to this metadata is completed it is going to be this so now what will happen we'll be just going to extend video right now next idals to ex video okay and here we'll be just going to use video prompt and the ID will be what last ID of this things it should ID uh it will be actually ID minus one IIs Sorry video prompt and then it will be iisus one that's it done basically it will keep on running keep on running keep on running like this thing once this thing is completely done once this is actually out of this Loop so what we'll do we'll be just going to write final ID final ID is actually going to be ID of minus one the last ID actually right because keep on doing the same ID do append equals to next ID right right I believe you understand right okay so once this thing is done then actually what is actually going to happen so this is the final ID okay right so how to actually uh get the link from that okay so final underscore meta data Final metadata will actually Cent do Generations dog okay do ID equals to final ID right now the link link will be uh link will be uh final metadata do assets final okay final not meta final metadata do assets do video I think final metadata. assets. video is actually going to give me the link and then if I write st. WR link and we can easily play the video sometime video does not play but it doesn't matter you will have the link it will be going to work link and then autop play equals to one thing we can do we can just give an additional uh sleep here time do sleep okay and so basically uh this will get the link whenever this thing is ready okay that's it so here I'll be just going to create a long length video B on this if I just run if I give 10 second it is this Loop is going to actually run for this Loop means this Loop where is the loop actually this Loop this Loop will run for two times and if I make it this Loop is actually going to run for three times like that way it is going to do it okay so without wasting much time I hope I haven't done much error so let's do this thing here okay okay everything is fine let's run this thing late on. hopefully this is running okay okay uh what is this invoke object has no attribute invoke there is a problem here let me take temp template which L actually the err temp template to in why this is saying that it is saying that AI message up has nothing called No attribute called invoke chain invoke is actually it is saying there is nothing called chain. invoke this is strange let me check why this is saying chain. invoke is uh not uh there so chain equals to prompt and llm equals to prompt LM equals to Shad this chain. invoke input really video prompt equals to response okay I think there is something else here actually problem is there not there actually response fine okay great let's refresh this page okay I I'll make it uh I don't know what is this the moon but okay oh no what is this why this is printing is here do print okay I did not put this thing here so if BT okay this is coming from the last thing okay so this entire thing will be actually going to be this side okay hopefully this is okay so let's refes now let's make it and we'll write busy state of New York on a Monday morning okay so let's write first going toate the pr it is generating the pr and rest of the things are actually working okay so let's see this is a previous error and something it is doing okay so let's see at the end it is actually going to generate the video because uh I have this uh things here like 15 second 15 second uh one thing you do uh because my IDs are generated here just to make sure it is working you can just write uh this ID in thei but to make it clean I'm not trying it but but but make sure you should do it so it is actually going to take at least 2 to 3 minute because uh it is going to uh create two videos and until and unless the first thing is actually not ready it is not going to the second thing and to make this thing ready it is going to at Le wait for 15 second two times and next time also it is going to wait for 16 two times so I'm expecting that this is actually going to take 2 minute at least okay so let's see if something I get it here no will take some time let's wait but good thing is I uh I make uh this link here available hopefully you'll be going to get the final link okay so let's see so here I'm just showing you 10c video but you can create 15 second 30 second 40 second video as well okay so maybe if I I I would like to recharge it for let's say 60 minutes sorry I will be going to recharge it for let's say 20 us and after that I'll be just going to create a 60c uh Instagram real maybe okay so let's see still it is doing so hopefully no error it's doing okay so let's wait no other option let me check if my closing things are working yeah the moment this is completed I just returning it I thought that I did not give a break statement so while one it is going here uh every time it is getting the metadata and it is checking the metadata if first time the metadata is not completed second time it will be completed same thing is actually here every time it is getting the metadata first time it is not completed maybe next time it will be completed right and I'm just returning it so no need to actually get the break and every time it is uh receiving uh the ID okay and this is first time it is receiving this ID first ID and next ID prompt and here actually uh next ID one this this first ID and ID a next ID and this ID of one means minus one final ID after that final ID I'm getting the metadata final metadata and I'm just getting the aid as well here okay hopefully this will work then it will write the link okay no error means uh it's still doing something let's wait no other option and wait for 3 4 minutes more okay okay yeah it's still working the extension of the video basically takes time so let's see one thing I one mistake I did I just uh didn't print that ID so that I can uh check in the background that what are the things actually created but let's see okay let's wait and the loop will tell for I range integer selected of five so selected d will be 0 and two okay yeah that's it if I equal to Z this is this and after that uh out of the follow Loop this is going to be this okay okay still actually it's running so yeah I'm using uh like credit but still actually it is very slow not sure why okay I'll wait till uh it is 1954 I'll wait till 8 okay and then I will stop because at Max it is going to take um maybe not more than 5 minutes actually let's wait sorry guys if you want you can skip it like in the video actual time but I can't skip it because it's a sequential activity so I have to wait it I have no other option okay so let's wait let me check if I am out of uh this uh I don't know whether my credits are l or not let me check API uh start building let me check my credit okay I have still 5.43 credit balances left okay use it let's check the usage yeah to the very high okay okay okay still doing it something I don't know what it is actually doing but still it is working that is a good thing that I have some credit left but is there any way where you can see what actually it is doing no I think no it is not possible okay so we have to wait okay let's wait let's wait but it is why is showing this I don't know I say time SLI 10 second here I'm just waiting for 15 second I should return and if is this Al met completed id id id response ID is actually coming from here so everything is fine I really don't know what is actually taking time okay more minutes I have I will wa okay so let's see and then I'll stop the execution and I'll just going to do some print statement so the where actually I'll be just going to put the print statement I'm just thinking I'll be just going to put the print statement um I'll just going to put the print statement here okay every time every time it is going to do this thing so here I'll be just going to put the print statement here I'll be just going to put the print statement okay maybe that could be this thing and here I'm just doing it so let's see it is still trying okay okay selected durations there is a spelling mistake I did s do select s selected option duration this selected option select acle C selected option okay fine so I believe this things are fine but um I really don't know why this is actually taking that much of time okay one more minute okay couple of things I just want to print so here I just want to actually uh in is actually if actually uh selected duration by five this in of this okay I just I'm doing this thing okay and I just want to print it okay and one more I want to print okay so this is not working let's stop it I don't know why it is not working some mistake maybe we did so this is something and here actually we want to print something okay so generating here every time I want to print this metadata I want to print the metadata okay and here I just want to print the IDS so first ID and next ID so every time whenever the ID is generated uh I want to write this thing in the UI so how to actually write this thing you can easily write. write so save stram actually ID is first ID and here also next ID next ID every time it is going to be next ID okay next ID next id ising id phone final ID is actually minus one then this final ID will be generation. get this then final metadata this this this okay fine let's try this thing one more time hopefully this will make some things clear okay hopefully so Dy New York State on a Monday morning okay let's see okay there will be two video okay you will see here first thing is generated here it is dreaming actually state is dreaming so basically it is here if it is not it is printing if it is not completed it will uh be going to pause here and again it is F uh let me state state is still raming okay so let's see let's wait so 50 second 15 second 15 second it is doing so still dreaming so let's wait I don't know how much time this is actually going to take okay still dreaming this is bad actually I don't know why actually it is taking that much of time but it is keep on dreaming dreaming dreaming okay still dreaming I don't know how long this is going to take for dreaming actually is it like I don't know whether there's a rate limit of something but uh this is not expected I didn't expect that actually okay so let it run like this okay if you see here it is still dreaming yeah but asset is actually asset came here if you see now the state is completed you see the state is completed but one ID I got okay so the first video is generated okay now the extension is actually going on okay okay now the second one is actually going on so dreaming okay now the second one is actually doing dreaming dreaming okay so basically right now it is here here okay let's see okay if you say the state is still dreaming here okay okay still joing okay it's done come so the the link is coming but the state is not completed maybe in the next part it will be completed if you see the link link from here right so let's see yeah it's completed now and so hopefully it will print something here okay the link also I got now after 10 second the video must be played here okay so yeah it's a 10c video amazing guys okay that's it that is what I want to actually show you guys this is super cool and amazing and if you see here it is created 9C uh video right so with the help of uh this tool and with the help of like U Luma a with uh credit can easily create something right this is starting from here so so guys are working right right this is not realistic the man is not realistic but still it is doing so basically now I'll be just going to do something uh uh beautiful lady down the street now winning of um Time Square on Monday night let's generate and I'm just kind of over ambitious for 15 second so let's do it I don't know whether it will be able to do it or not but let's give a try okay let's see okay so it's doing let's see okay so this is uh working so basically this will uh create a beautiful uh this will create a beautiful lady walking down the street of on a busy evening of Time Square on Monday night my English is not correct here properly sorry for that but this will create something just wait wait for it okay so children okay I didn't think anything is created yet let me check yeah nothing is created everything is dreaming dreaming dreaming one will be created just now so first MP4 I can see in this 15 second it will be created completed so here I'll be able to see the first link is Right Z ID the first video ID is this one there will be one means index wise it is index wise it is actually zero but number wise it is first okay so let's wait okay where is the dream yeah is dreaming actually prompt is super cool am am Time Squares Monday night bule she glided like a waser dream oh my God it's super cool so guys those are young and looking for some impressive English quotation to impress your girlfriend so probably you guys can use this power of AI okay jokes apart okay so we are actually waiting for the second image I think this is created right completed I think second one is actually ready so third one then we'll be going to wa some time and we'll be able to see that okay okay hi this is taking time I don't know basically every video is taking at least a minute to generate yep so it's generated so if you see here this thing is generated now in 15 second we'll be able to see the link let's wait 1 2 3 for like that way in 10 second it is ready oh my God so I don't know whether she is beautiful or not but yeah this is super cool okay so I said 15 second this is generated like this okay so yeah okay something generated okay yeah okay so that's it guys that
